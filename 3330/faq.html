		<h3>How does this class fit into the rest of the interpreting classes here at UVU?</h3>
		<p>ASL3330 is named Interpreting II (the third class in UVU&#8217;s interpreting class series), focusing on the discussion of cross-cultural communication with respect to bi-directional interpreting for Deaf and non-Deaf people. (Prior to the Fall 2003 semester, ASL3330 was previously ASL4320.) Here&#8217;s where it fits into the program:</p>

		<h3>When does class meet?</h3>
		<p>Class time and period are <span class="smallcaps">MW</span> 7:30&#8211;8:45 pm in LA003f. <a href="syllabus.html">Read the syllabus</a> for more information.</p>
		<h3>How can I contact the instructor?</h3>
		<p>The best way to contact me is via e-mail. <a href="contact.html">Go to the contact page</a> for more information.</p>
		<h3>How do I get a good grade in this class?</h3>
		<p>Course final grades are determined by combining both
			<ol>
				<li>scores on all of the <a href="assignments.html">submitted assignments and exams</a></li>
				<li>considering assessed performance on your <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dEFvQW81b0NCSjNsb19aOUh6NXJ6REE6MA..">student-teacher contract</a>.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>More importantly, you should remember that making decisions in interpreting situations or producing interpreting work <span class="hilite">is <em>really</em> all about efficient and fluent problem solving</span>: identifying and then applying knowledge to resolve communication differences. </p>
		<p>While some portions of your coursework and quizzes will test for specific factual information (<em>remembering</em> skills), far less important is your ability to regurgitate facts and figures. Instead, <a href="assignments.html">outlines, postings/discussions, and exams</a> are designed to identify how well you internalize principles, cultural and technical knowledge, and process understanding, and then apply them to create solutions to various situations (<em>applying</em> and <em>analyzing</em> skills).</p>

Skills higher up on the pyramid are necessary for equivalent interpreting; our class assignments and exams will require you to demonstrate performance on several levels.</li>

		<p><a href="assignments.html">Scoring criteria</a> are clearly defined on assignment handouts or exams; you&#8217;ll know what you need to do to <a href="syllabus.html">earn the grade you want</a>. Ultimately, your grade is a reflection of personal effort and internalization of concepts learned in the course.</p>
		<h3>When are assignments due? When is the final? What&#8217;s on the quizzes? The exams?</h3>
		<p>All schedule-related questions can be answered on the <a href="schedule.html">class schedule</a>. Final exams cannot be given early or on any other date than what is proscribed by the college. Please don&#8217;t ask. All quizzes will consist of questions designed to test your knowledge of class lectures and important information found in the text and handouts; all exams written assessments of your understanding of the course materials. <a href="assignments.html">Read more on the assignments page</a>.</p>
		<h3>Do you have any class notes or handouts on this site?</h3>
		<p>Most of the information in the teacher&#8217;s presentations and lecture outline is found in your text. Sometimes, specific class notes or charts may be distributed on an infrequent basis. These handouts are important; exam and discussion materials will also come from these resources. All of the class handouts and some lecture materials <a href="schedule.html">can be found on the schedule</a>.</p>
