		<h3>Due Dates and Missing Exams/Classes</h3>
		<p>Please adhere to all due dates on your class schedule. Exams are given only during the pre-assigned examination period (see &#8220;5. Exams and Quizzes&#8221; below right). <span class="hilite">Except for <em>extremely</em> exceptional instances, a make-up exam will not be available</span>. Giving a make-up exam is unfair to those students who have made the effort to complete the exam on time.</p>
		<p>Work schedules, out-of-town trips, or dating habits are not valid excuses for missing exams. If you must miss an assignment, please see me <span class="hilite"><em>before the exam day</em></span> to discuss your conflict. Final exams cannot be given early or on any other date than what is proscribed by the College. Please don&#8217;t ask.</p>
		<p>All papers are to be typewritten; no handwritten papers will be accepted.</p>
		<h3>Assignment Breakdown</h3>

		<h3>Deaf Community Experience Projects <span style="font-weight: normal;">(optional, but encouraged)</span></h3>
		<p><span class="firstline">You want me to do <em>what</em>?</span> For these assignments, you should seek out Deaf Community- or interpreter-related activities. Your best resource is the main gathering place for most of the Deaf and interpreting community in Weber, Salt Lake, and Utah Counties, the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=5709+South+1500+West,+Salt+Lake+City,+UT&sll=40.647788,-111.933888&sspn=0.355826,0.529404&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=5709+S+1500+W,+Salt+Lake+City,+Salt+Lake,+Utah+84123&ll=40.64758,-111.933882&spn=0.01112,0.016544&z=16">Sanderson Community Center of the Deaf</a> in Taylorsville. There are activities constantly taking place here, ranging from athletics to political meetings to interpreting workshops. <a href="http://deafservices.utah.gov/">Check the Center</a> for 1) a current list of activities and 2) ask if it is appropriate that students may attend a certain activity. Fees may apply. And, when it comes to privacy, Deaf people are no different than hearing people; ask first before just assuming you can show up to any activity.</p>
		<p>Other resources can be found at Salt Lake Community College (Redwood Road campus) or here in Utah County; <a class="smallcaps" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/BYU-ASL-CLUB/153072054600">BYU</a>, <a class="smallcaps" href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=86095565110&v=info">UVU</a>, and <a class="smallcaps" href="http://www.slcc.edu/asl/aslclub.asp">SLCC</a> have active, on-going, on-campus <span class="smallcaps">ASL</span> clubs; <span class="smallcaps">UVU</span> has <a href="http://uvu.edu/asd/currentstudents/services.html">periodic inservice for its interpreters</a>. You may even have Deaf friends who are students here at <span class="smallcaps">UVU</span> or <span class="smallcaps">BYU</span>. Explain your assignment to them, and ask what activities may be happening around the area.</p>
		<p>Take advantage of your participation to obtain real-life practical experience in relation to <span class="hilite"><em>interpreting opportunities</em></span> within the Deaf Community. Interact with people&#8212;get involved, ask questions, take opportunities to learn. Make your experience unique and worthwhile. If you need to, ask the instructor for direction and/or clarification. At the end of these experience, write about your interactions.</p>
		<p><span class="firstline">What this assignment is not.</span> The purpose of this assignment is not to gaze into the proverbial fishbowl nor see how many Deaf people you can hang out and party with (although new social experiences may be a fringe benefit at times.) Your participation in the community for which you may someday provide interpreting services is contingent on your perceived relationship with the community. Instead of looking for “how do you sign that?” opportunities or just hanging out at league volleyball night, look for ways to build reciprocity, learn about and challenge current situations where interpreters are working, and get in tune with the local interpreting community.</p>
		<p><em>Note</em>: Because Utah and Salt Lake Counties are predominantly heavily <a href="http://deaflds.org/na_ut_id.html">Latter-day Saint (<span class="smallcaps">LDS</span>) populated</a>, many Deaf community activities are also religious activities. <span class="hilite"><strong>It is not</strong> an acceptable alternative for this assignment to attend Deaf church services</span>; your involvement and interaction at a church meeting is not indicative of a typical Deaf Community function. If, however, you wish to <a href="http://uad.org/utahresources/churches.htm">investigate religious services</a> as one of your assignments, please discuss your intent with the instructor.</p>

		<h3>Semester Assignments</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><span class="firstline">Student-teacher contract.</span> Determine the parameters of a <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dGNIZzY4eDVPMW5fVzZSTjNOS09UeGc6MQ">contract between you and the instructor</a> that will help determine the evaluation and measurement of your in-class performance this semester. What grade do you want? Why? Thoughtfully include what requirements, stipulations, and conditions you&#8217;ll need to satisfy in order to warrant the grade you want to earn from this class. Additionally, explain what you feel the instructor can do/should do to enable your best performance. See the <a href="schedule.html">class schedule</a>; this contract is worth ten points. <span class="hilite">Late submissions will not be accepted.</span></li>
			<li><span class="firstline">Chapter outlines.</span> To help you internalize concepts in our primary text, you&#8217;ll be required to <a href="http://www.lavc.edu/library/outline.htm">compile outlines</a> on chapters 2&#8211;5, 7&#8211;8, and 10&#8211;13. These basic yet fairly comprehensive outlines:
				<ul>
					<li>encourage your readings in the text</li>
					<li>help you highlight specific areas of question for in-class discussions and exam preparation</li>
					<lI>(While we will not be formally reading or writing outlines on chapters 1, 6, and 9, we may bring elements of these readings into our discussions.)</lI>
				</ul>
				Outlines are due at the beginning of the first class of a new chapter (<a href="schedule.html">see class schedule for due dates</a>). Completion of an outline indicates that you have studied the chapter; if you haven&#8217;t, don&#8217;t turn in an outline. Faked and rushed outlines are easily spotted and greatly undermine the class&#8217;s trust. Late outlines will not be accepted.</li>
			<!-- <li><span class="firstline">Begin volume one of your Interpreting Journal.</span> This assignment gives you the opportunity to build foundational interpreting (reading, writing, spelling, creative thinking, problem solving, visualizing) skills as well as develop a broad base of knowledge. You'll be required to keep an information journal, a place to gather interesting or pertinent vocabularies and materials on a variety of subjects, either academic or general interest. As you acquire information, then use your journal as a place to solve interpreting-related problems: How do Deaf people sign that concept? How is that idea used in English? What does this word mean? <a href="schedule.html">See class schedule for due dates</a>.</li> !-->
			<li><span class="firstline">Response Postings/Discussions.</span> We&#8217;ll be using the <a href="http://www.schoology.com/course/2043077">online classroom</a> to comment on preassigned topics (and any additional projects this semester):
				<ul>
					<li>At the very least, you&#8217;ll be required to 1) submit salient (read: thought-out and reasoned college level writing and thinking) <span class="hilite">posts about your perceptions of the topics</span> and 2) <span class="hilite">make comments on other students&#8217; posts and thoughts</span>. </li>
					<li>At best, you should endeavor to continue the threads you start, and <span class="hilite">really engage your fellow students</span> (think: your fellow interpreting peers and colleagues) in a discourse about these topics</li>
					<li>Additionally, you&#8217;re encouraged to use <a href="http://www.schoology.com/course/2043077">your blog as a journal</a> to capture ideas, thoughts, and multimedia about interpreting practice and theory.</li>
				</ul>
			<a href="writing.html">You&#8217;ll want to understand more about the criteria</a> for the depth and breadth of your postings. Additionally, all writing assignments are identified on the <a href="schedule.html">class schedule</a> in <span class="lab"><strong>orange</strong></span>. As a reminder, submitting a post indicates that you have actually read and put forth effort; faked work is easily identified, and will result in a reduced or failing grade on the assignment. <span class="hilite">Late postings will be penalized at 10% <em>per day</em> (not class period).</span> Feel free to ask the instructor for direction at any time.</li>
			<li><span class="firstline">Midterm Evaluation.</span> About halfway through the semester, it&#8217;ll be time for a <em>kumbaya</em> of sorts, let the instructor know how you&#8217;re doing&#8212;&#8220;great,&#8221; &#8220;bored,&#8221; &#8220;frustrated&#8221;: get it out. It&#8217;ll be anonymous of course, but it will help you and the instructor do any course correcting if needed. Watch the <a href="schedule.html">class schedule</a> in February for this; this evaluation is worth an easy-peasy ten points. <span class="hilite">Late submissions will not be accepted</span>.</li>
			<li><span class="firstline">Exams and Quizzes.</span> There will be <a href="schedule.html">two exams and one final (comprehensive) exam given during the semester</a>. Additionally, this semester (Spring 2011), <span class="highlight">we&#8217;ll be experimenting with online exams</span>. Exams will be open for a finite time period and submitted to the instructor at the end of the end of the exam period. The purpose of completing and submitting exams outside of our normal class period flow is two-fold:
			<ul>
				<li>it gives us three extra days of discussion and instruction back that we would otherwise lose to sitting in class taking a test</li>
				<li>it allows you to have an appropriate amount of time to craft a representative and comprehensive answer</li>
			</ul>
			<h6>&nbsp;</h6>
			More details will be shared in class. Additionally, periodic unannounced quizzes may be given, to be completed in the <a href="http://www.schoology.com/course/2043077">online classroom</a> in a primarily written/short answer format, and designed to assess your knowledge of concepts discussed in lectures, readings, and handouts. Unless there&#8217;s an absolutely exceptional reason, <span class="hilite">there is no makeup final exam</span> (see &#8220;Due Dates and Missing Exams/Classes&#8221; above).</li>
			<li><span class="firstline">Deaf Community Experiences (enrichment).</span> Based on the criteria described at left under &#8220;Deaf Community Experience Projects,&#8221; post your experiences on your online classroom blog. In your postings discuss:
				<ul>
					<li>Your thoughts during this interaction with Deaf people in relation to the interpreting field. Be honest. Be detailed. Were you surprised at what you learned? Did your feelings about interpreting change during this assignment? How? Why? Explain.</li>
					<li>Other people&#8217;s actions and reactions towards you and your reactions to their behavior.</li>
					<li>Any new awareness and/or insight about interpreting in the community that you had not expected or thought of. Did you gain any new understanding as to the reasons for certain behaviors or cultural mor&#233;s that Deaf people have? Explain.</li>
					<li>Any anecdotes or descriptions of events that happened that seemed significant or helpful to your experience.</li>
				</ul>
				<h6>&nbsp;</h6>
				<span class="hilite">While these are not required</span>, you may complete as many of these assignments as you want during the semester. Review the <a href="writing.html">Tips for Writing</a> guidelines and criteria for how these assignments will be evaluated. If you need to, ask the instructor for direction and/or clarification.
