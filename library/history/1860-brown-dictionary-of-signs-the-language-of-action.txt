These planes aro all cut perpendicularly, at rigllt anglas. by the Zero and Central planes; and these last, also, cut ench other laterally at the same angle.
The Central plane, 0 , is Il perpendicular plune supposed to cut the body, from front to rear, and from iloa(1 to foot, through ils centre, dividing it iuto equal right and left portions, and extending indefinitely forward und backward. Roman numerals Ilt the right of n plane letter, indicate (list-'macs in palms' breadths to the right of this plane, the same kind of numer::tIs at the left of a plane letter, indicate distances in palms' breadths to tho left of this plane. 'fhus, N v indicates a point on the plane N, five palms to the right of the Central plano; wiliie, iv N indicates (L point on the plano N, four palms to the left of the Central plane.
Tho Zero, 0, pl:me rests on the front of the face, boily, and toes, and extends indefinitely to     right and left. Distances from tMs plane in front, are markcil, I, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and!): distances in the rear of tilis plalle, arc marked by the samenumeralswitha        signprefixedj thus,-1,-2,-3,-4,--5,-6, _7, -8, and -9. 'l'hus, 1 II indicates a point on the plane H, one palm in frontoftheplane0; und-4Smeansonthelliane5,fourpalmsinthetenrof the plane o.
I t is sometimes nocesBary to indicate portions of a palm's breadth in measuring to the right and left: this is done by a fractional expression; thus,    'W indicates a point on the plane 'V, one aud one-lialf palms to the left of the Central plane C. The expression, i S, means on the plane S, three-fourths of a palm to the left of the plnne C.
Simultaneous positions of bot11 IHmds on the same plane. are iudicated by writing the series of numer6ls indicating dist..'\nces in connexion with the plane letter. The tenna, 4v S 4vi, indicate, the left hand placed on the plane S, fOllr palms in front of the plane 0, nn(I five palms to the left of tho ]llane C j and, at the same timc, the right hand placed on the lllrllle S, four palms in front of 0, and six palms to the right of the Illa11e C. Tho series, 3vii 4ii II, indicate both Imnds placed on II at the left of 0; the left hand tllrCo lJnlms in front of 0, !lnd sevCn palms to tho left of C; Ilnd the right haud four palms in front of 0, and two palms to t110 left of C.
Simultaneous pOllitions of the hands on different plfl.nes, arc inilic,1te(1 by writing the numerals and Illane Ictters together,           only by a colon. Thus 5ii ,r: II Giii indicate, the left hanel 011 the Illune \\r, fivo palms in front of 0, and two palms to the Jrfe of 0; nnd, lit the SlIllle time, the right hl\11d on the plane H, six palms in front of 0, and three palms to tho right of C.

            PREFACE. v
In all eMes wllere simllltnneous positions of the IHinds arc indicated, the first series of Ilumerals indicates the position of the left. the secolld scries that of tho right hand. Thus. in 4viii 5iv     the position first of the left hand, tllen of the right is expressed.
A contillued movement of one or both hands, may be indictlted by the numerals and plane letters mnrking the points IIlIcecssiv('ly passed. Thus: Carry both hands through "iii S 3i, 3ii M 4i, 5i H 5ii, 6v 'V: 5ii C, means tllat the hands are to be carried from point to point, simultnneously and successivcly, as here stated.

The palm down, means the IJalm presented directly down, the band lying II0ri1;ontally.
Palm up, means the palm presented directly up the hand lying horizontally. The hand, palm outwnrd. incliniug forward; mcans the hand witll the palm

Closed IHmd, second phalnnges down, means tlle l13.nd slmt as in the letter A and tunled, 50 tht' the second phalnnges resting on n llOrizontal plane would be presented directly townrds tlle earth.
Closed hand, thumb up, moons the hand closed as befonl. and 80 held tbat the thumb is the uppermost PMt.
Extended hand, thllmb up, means the hand and fingers fully e:dended, nlld so llCld that the tllUmb is the \LppcnllOst part; not, by any mellllS, thnt it points up.
'l'he tip of the hand, or the point of the hand, menns the part nenr the ends of tho fingers, the lingers being sido by side, nnd regarded fUI n portion of the hand.
Closed band, little-finger down, means the hand closed and held, 80 that the different parts of this linger would rc"t on a horizontal plane, aud 00 presented towards the earth.
Curved hand. or hand curved, menns the hand bent so as to form n }1011ow betwccn tiLe tip and the renr Ilnl't of the palm, UIld the thumb out from the hand, 118 in making the letter C.

         vi

III gellcral, upward, downward, forwards, backward, ill referring to positions of tho hand, clc. are to be understood as indicating positions illciining towarus a lwrizontal IlJanc, at IW angle of about forty-five degrees; the same rule applies to movements, so far as upward and downward arc concerned; whiJe forwards and backwards am used in designating movements making similar angles with the Centra! :md Zero planes, though in Of parallel to the horiZOlltal ones_
In general, up, down, forward, back, in referring to positions of the hand, etc. arc to be understood as indicating positions at right angles with a horizontal plane; the same rule applies to 1ll0YClllellts, so far as up and down are COll- cerned; wllile forward and back are used ill designating movements making similar nngles with the Cenu-al alld Zero plnncs, tbough in or parallel to the horiwntal Olles.
'l.'he term out refers to a position of the llaml wllcn the back or the palm is turned diredly awny from the body or person; as applied to movements, it refers to such as proceed direetlyawny from the body or person. Outward refers to a position of the IHllld when the buck or palm is not turned directly away from tJ1C body or person, but makes an nllglc of about forty-fivc degrees Witll such a position; as applied to movements, it refers to such as proceed in the direction thus indicatcd.
It frequently becomes llecessury to refcl' to definitions wllCn severnl signs aTC given for the sume word: so that it may be known what particular meanings ure embraced under oach sign.

The personal sign, is one wllich is cmployetl to designate a penon in distinc- tion from an employment, a condition, an OCClillation, a mentnl or pllysical nct, thing or allY other essential or accid()ll\ai circllmst::mcc. '!'his sign is made by placing the palms of the cxtcmlcd hands pointing toward each other just below Oi, N Oi, on tho breast, the tips of the hands nenr!y meeting; :ll1d t1ms carrying the hands down the frout of the body to Q.i W Oi. This sign owes its origin to the npron which an artisan wears, which, covering ns it docs the frollt of the person, becomes It sign for tJle person. 'fhus, by nJding tllis- sign to that for the verb serve, we havo the sign for son·ant; to legislate, and wo hnye Iegi81ntol'; to benefit, 3mI we imye benefnctor; to Inw, and we have lawyer; to deceiye, and we ]lnve, decciYcr, etc. ctc.
,fIlen it becomes nCC(lssary to refer in describing tlle sign for a word, to a sign made for the same won} as another part of          it is done withellt repeating in each case, that the sign for t.hat pnrt of speech    to bo cilnng<'u or wholly omitted: this is, Ilowe\·er, nlll'ays to be lIJ1{lcrstood. IV-hen HUlkillg signs m·on in the orocr of written Jnngnagc, it is llOt IIC\:cssmy to mllke the sign for the part of speecll, except in cases where mislIndcrstnlJ(lillg or confllsion of ideus might thus result; ill these instUllces tI1C sign for the p.ut of speech should be invariably added.
