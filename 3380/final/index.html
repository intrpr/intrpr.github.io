			<question><strong>Assignment Scenario and Logistics</strong></question>
			<paragraph>
				<span class="large">You have been asked to provide transliteration services for breakout sessions at a collector’s convention this week. You’ll be working with a mixed gender, age, and education audience, ranging from a couple of local community college students to older people in their late fifties and early sixties.<br><br>
				<em>Your first breakout session after lunch will last approximately five minutes and consist of <strong>an introduction to the history, particulars, and unique nature of baseball card collecting</strong>.</em></span>

			<question>
				<strong>Qualifications and Small Print</strong><br><br>
				This evaluation is in no way intended, nor implied, nor should be construed as a substitute for a state interpreter certification test and/or diagnostic evaluation. Typical certification or diagnostic exams can take up to three months to fully analyze and evaluate. Unfortunately, time is limited in this setting.
			</question>
			<paragraph>
				This portion of your evaluation will be evaluated much like a state interpreter certification test and/or diagnostic examination. As with your other work in this class, the purpose of this evaluation is to 1) analyze your transliteration work; 2) recognize in/equivalences, successful or unsuccessful patterns, and/or tendencies in the work; and then 3) make suggestions on those patterns and tendencies. You should be mindful of and familiar with the criteria used to evaluate your skills indicated on the enclosed evaluation rubric.<br><br>
				Though imperfect, instead of a pass or fail score, this evaluation attempts to assign a quantifiable score based on the interpretation: 100 points is a <em>perfect</em> interpretation, consequently, 70 points is an average interpretation, denoting numerous errors and/or unsuccessful patterns in the work. Admittedly, this is not a perfect assessment but it should give you an idea of successful (or unsuccessful) patterns in the work.<br><br>
				Please read all the instructions <em>carefully</em>; you are responsible for fulfilling all requirements. This exam is designed to evaluate your spoken English-to-ASL <em>transliteration</em> skills.
			</paragraph>
			<paragraph><strong>Assignment Logistics</strong><br>
				<ul>
					<li>This is a Spoken English to English-bound Sign simultaneous transliteration pre-assessment text; the main point of this exercise is to establish where your current transliterating skills are as of the end of the semester (April 2016).</li>
					<li>Please do not discuss your experience, the subject matter, or any other scenario logistics with other class members.</li>
					<li><strong>Please ensure your transliteration can be seen on the video.</strong> You may want make a quick test clip to make sure your entire signing area can be seen in the video. Also, if you are filming split screen in the lab, <strong>please make sure you are in the dominant frame.</strong></li>
					<li>When the recording begins, please 1) fingerspell (no name signs) your name and 2) label this evaluation (i.e. “final video for ASL3380”)</li>
					<li>Complete your transliteration.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				You should consider preparing for this assignment by reviewing and using the tools and approaches you’ve learned this semester:
					<ul>
						<li>understanding what transliteration actually is</li>
						<li>working within the MCE spectrum (between English and American Sign Language) to decide on linguistic solutions for semantic problems</li>
						<li>understanding where and how transliterating is best applied</li>
						<li>developing intralingual skills:
							<ul>
								<li>Oral components of transliteration</li>
								<li>Parts of speech</li>
								<li>Fingerspelling</li>
								<li>Modifying source language</li>
								<li>Name signs, initialized signs, depicting verbs</li>
								<li>Using space, reflexive/indexing, pronominalization</li>
								<li>Subject/object agreement</li>
								<li>Manipulating voice</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

					</ul>
			</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, you should plan to complete a short online evaluation about your experience with this assignment, explaining the types of approaches you used, how and what you did to prepare for this assignment, and briefly give any concluding comments about the assignment. You will receive an email with a link to the evaluation; please check your email account shortly after the assignment.</paragraph>
