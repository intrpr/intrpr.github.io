		<h2>Chapter 2: <br>The Influence Of Utah School for the Deaf and The L.D.S. Branch for the Deaf in the Early Development of a Cohesive Deaf Society in Utah</h2>
		<h1><span class="hide"><a href="#">&#x25B2; back to top</a></span>Part I — The Sociology of the Utah School for the Deaf in the Community, 1880–1910</h1>
		<h3>Early Deaf Utahns Were Educated or Tutored at Home</h3>
		<p>In the Territory of Utah, state educational agencies did not exist until 1877, and the Salt Lake City Board of Education was not established until in 1890. No child in Utah had a public education, much less the Deaf ones (Anne Leahy, personal communication, June 7, 2011).</p>
		<p>Between 1850 and 1880, most early Deaf Utahns were educated or tutored at home by their parents. Laron Pratt, son of LDS Church Apostle Orson Pratt became deaf at the age of three and was educated at home. Sarah Eckersley, who became deaf at eighteen months and was nine years old when her family immigrated to Utah, was tutored at home by her mother. Although Nephi Larson entered the Utah School for the Deaf in 1889, he did not participate in any public education until age thirty when his father finally enrolled him in the new classes at the University of Deseret. Most of his formative education came from his father, “with his help he learned a little arithmetic...[while also] help[ing] his father on the farm in summer” (Gallaher, 1898). Mary Irene Foote, born in Fort Union (Salt Lake) in 1855, and who had two other Deaf sisters (that probably helped in her education), was taught at home by her father, who was a schoolteacher. Likewise, at least sixteen families of Deaf siblings (two and three Deaf siblings, and, in the case of the Wright family of Bountiful, five Deaf siblings) account for a substantial percentage the roughly two hundred known Deaf citizens of the Utah Territory between 1848 and 1890 (Doug Stringham, personal communication, June 2, 2011).</p>
		<p>An interesting case of another early educated Deaf Utahn was John Sherratt, a Mormon convert in 1846 who immigrated to Utah and settled in (Fort) Cedar City in the mid-1850s. He was born into a privileged English family, became Deaf at a very young age (scarlet fever), and was tutored and taught at home. While he struggled as a farmer, he was often hired out as an accountant and bookkeeper because of his penmanship and mathematics skills. Deaf adults who immigrated west might have attended schools for the deaf in the east (e.g. Henry C. White), but, deaf children had very few options during Utah's territorial period (Doug Stringham, personal communication, June 2, 2011).</p>
		<h3>The Founding of the Utah School for the Deaf</h3>
		<p>Since the founding of the Utah School for the Deaf in Utah in Salt Lake City in 1884, the school made a significant change in the lives of its students. Students who attended the school in the early period developed a sense of community (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>As the school grew, younger students made up the majority of the student body. The dynamics of their social interaction changed and the opportunities for individual growth and independence dramatically improved over the years. Education and social skills were provided where the students learned to develop the skills to work together, obtain employment and contribute to society. Marriage patterns of the deaf as well as vocational training changed over the years (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>Under the influence of the school, the nature of the Deaf community changed. USD trained the students to become the future leaders of the new urban deaf society centered in Salt Lake City and Ogden. The school also helped establishing the social organizations of the deaf within the state as well as outside of the state. The leadership training experiences gave students an opportunity to serve in responsible positions within the social, educational, religious, and vocational organizations (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>Before the USD was founded, the individuals from congenital deaf hereditary backgrounds had more experience with other deaf people than those individuals with hearing backgrounds who later became deaf. Congenitally deaf individuals usually had deaf siblings, parents, or other relatives with whom they related. They also developed relationship with other deaf individuals. Those with hearing backgrounds experienced greater isolation. After the founding of the USD, unlike the congenitally deaf, these individuals had an advantage because often they could speak before becoming deaf. Learning sign language allowed them to communicate with both deaf and hearing worlds easier than the congenitally deaf individuals who had difficulty learning to speak (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>When the Utah School for the Deaf was formed in 1884, Laron Pratt who was 37 years old at the time and was an early Deaf leader, published his “Deaf Mutes: A Good Word in Behalf of the Unfortunates” essay to the editor of the Deseret News applauding the legislature’s provision for education of Deaf children in Utah Territory and gives an insider’s view of the culture for a hearing audience (Anne Leahy, personal communication, June 3, 2011). He wrote:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Deaf Mutes<br>A Good Word in Behalf of the Unfortunates</p>
			<p>Salt Lake City, April 16, 1884<br>
			Editor Deseret News:</p>
			<p>It is with a degree of pleasure that I note the fact that the Legislature at its last session, made provision for the instruction and education of the unfortunate deaf and dumb of the Territory, in its primary branches, a much needed and long desired measure which cannot but be of benefit to them. Though the number of deaf mutes in our Territory are but few, it is a step in the right direction to aid them to become useful and self supporting citizens, that they may not be a charge thrown up the community.</p>
			<p>I have had a varied experience of some thirty years among these unfortunate beings, and I will say that though this faculty—the faculty of hearing—has been denied them, it is nevertheless true that most if not all are capable of being educated to a better standard of excellence in intellectual and moral culture.</p>
			<p>Doubtless it would be interesting to many who do not understand these beings, to give a short sketch upon their mode of life and peculiar way of making themselves understood by those with whom they come in contact.</p>
			<p>These are different grades of deafness and dumbness, which may be classified as follows: Those who have been born deaf and dumb are naturally the hardest to bring to an understanding of even the most simple, every-day things. As they grow up and their faculties begin to expand, a vast amount of patience and perseverance will be required of those under whose charge they are placed to bring them to a comprehension of the plainest affair, that is in their uneducated state. Their brain possesses almost the same functions as that of other beings, but are very dormant and of slow growth, aptness not being a characteristic, and rather conspicuous for its absence. They are capable of being educated, but only by object lessons—always have an object to point to when trying to make them comprehend, such as a picture, etc.—they can learn most of the words in common use. Then you bring them to understand the meaning of words by persistently pointing at the object of the sentence; they will thus known what is meant, but they will not know the sound of the word, even of dog, cat, etc. When educating this class many difficulties are to be met with. It would be requisite not only to have a large share of patience, but a good facial expression, with the power to denote love, hate, sorrow, humor, etc., thereon. Deaf and dumb are able to understand facial expression and are quick to comprehend every variety and expression of the human countenance; it amount to an intuition; nothing escapes their notice. Another thing required will be an expressive gesture, not only of the arms, fingers and shrug of the shoulders, but a peculiar movement of the whole body, in imitation and illustration of the subject you may be speaking of. They have a peculiar gesture to denote father, mother, sister, brother, uncle, aunt, etc., and for all the numerous objects that surround them, and whole sentences can be brought to their understanding by a simple gesture of the arm and face. When made familiar with words and objects they will be soon able to connect sentences and learn to put them in proper shape. I have met many deaf mates of eastern cities who considered themselves as having a good education, still in their conversation, which they usually write on small slates carried about in the pocket for that purpose—they seem to have the greatest difficulty in joining sentences together, and they have a rather peculiar way of doing it. Their general mode of conversing among themselves is not only be gestures, but also by means of the deaf and dumb alphabet—single or double; with one hand or with both. In many cases they can spell the object but do not know the meaning, which is explained to them by gesture.</p>
			<p>Another class are those who have lost their hearing and in some cases their speech by disease, such as scarlet ever or some great sickness. Some are made totally deaf through the auditory nerve of the ear being destroyed, and some through catarrh and various other diseases. The mental and intellectual faculties of this class are of a superior organization to those of the other, and may, by cultivation, be brought up to a much higher plain. In fact this class may be educated to any degree on a par with the most intelligent being—their reasoning powers and mental capacity to grasp at ideas being the same—with the exception of hearing, and may be taught the sciences, different languages, etc., but is it doubtful whether they can ever attain to a higher degree of perfection or even excellence. They are naturally very sensitive as well as suspicious and generally get very much embarrassed when trying to pronounce a word that they cannot accentuate properly. This grade also have a peculiar way of their won in speaking, being generally through the medium of signs, but more particularly by the formation of words shaped by the mouth. It must be understood that those who are of this latter class, namely—deaf through disease—will be able to talk aloud in most instances like any other person, if brought up to it. And while being able to express themselves understandingly are still in a measure mute—the loss of the hearing more or less affecting the glands of the throat, which are in sympathy with the auditory nerve of the ear, rendering the voice thick, and it cannot be made to harmonize with the variety of sounds produced in speaking. Still they are able to get along in that way without the aid of many signs. If you will converse with an intelligent person who is thus afflicted by writing on a piece of paper or a slate, he will be found to be equal in ideas, expression and refinement to the most intelligent beings, but it is difficult for a person not well acquainted with their habit of understanding the lips by the forming of words thereon without sound to converse really intelligently by that mode. These unfortunates, according to the degree of education they may secure, and according to their intellectual capacity, are able to obtain a fair share of pleasure therefrom. They can more or less enjoy sounds. Even music has its charms. They may all hear different sounds, by this mode:</p>
			<p>When a piano or instrument is being played they either put their feet against it or their hand on it, and thus what a mute may say he “heard” is conveyed by the jar of the sound on the nervous system, which vibrates along the member touching the instrument and communicates through the whole body, producing a most delightful music and sensation, and giving a tolerable idea of what music is. A piece of elastic rubber, with one end in the mouth between the teeth and stretched, and with one finger striking it in the middle makes it vibrate. This will give a tolerably fair idea of the sensation of sound. </p>
			<p>I would by all means encourage the parents and guardians of these unfortunates to send them to the Deseret University, for by not doing so they know not the pleasure they are depriving them of—the capacity to enjoy what few pleasures fall to them. If they are too poor to send them to the institution, then, in the name of common humanity, let those who profess to be their friends show by their actions and not words—by subscribing means to that end—their appreciation of the condition of their unfortunate fellow-creatures.</p>
			<p>Respectfully,<br>Laron Pratt (Deseret News, Apr. 1884) </p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Laron was a classic post-lingually Deaf person of higher social status who recognized his advantage and chooses to parlay his dual citizenship (in the deaf and hearing worlds) into a kind of insider/advocate bridge role. He was decidedly not grass roots, but also did not reject those who were (Anne Leahy, personal communication, June 3, 2011).</p>

			<h5><strong>Editor's note</strong>: much of the information in the following section is based on Elaine Roberts' 1994 masters thesis "The Early History of the Utah School for the Deaf and its Influence in the Development of a Cohesive Deaf society in Utah, c. 1884–1905" about the sociology of USD and its students. However, due to recent research by Stringham &#38; Leahy (in progess), information in this section is rapidly subject to change.</h5>

	<h3>Marriage of Deaf Students</h3>
		<p>Similar to Martha’s Vineyard, a pattern of the genetic congenital deafness often came from families by inbreeding and intermarriage in rural areas, especially in the isolated areas of southern Utah. Many families with deaf children intermarried, which tended to perpetuate the hereditary nature of this deafness. Several families probably carrying deaf genes joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints early in the West Virginia area. They migrated to southern Utah together and later President Brigham Young of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sent these families to Utah with other members of their families. They continued to intermarry with one or two deaf family members arriving in each generation. Since the founding of Utah School for the Deaf, several of these deaf children attended the school. A few deaf individuals married. Most of them stayed at home and helped the family (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>The intermarriage in Utah also played down the influence of polygamy as a means of passing genetic deafness. As the Martha’s Vineyard intermarriage declined, the intermarriage among the families drastically diminished after the founding of Utah School for the Deaf, especially among students who came to the school. They were given the opportunity to meet other deaf individuals from other areas of the state. The result of socialization being offered at school became a shift in deaf marriage patterns (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>Over the years, the dynamics of deaf marriage changed dramatically with the growth of the Utah School for the Deaf. Before the founding of the Utah School for the Deaf, marriage patterns of the deaf students differed from the hearing population; they married at an older age than the public at large. Most of them were not married and not very many deaf individuals lived independently. They remained at home as maiden aunts and uncles to help maintain the peace within their family home or married someone from their local area. At that time, most deaf educators and advocates did not support marriage between deaf individuals. Often time, they married a hearing spouse who would compensate for their deafness (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>Over one-third of deaf individuals before 1890 were never married. Three possible explanations for the absence of marriage by early students include:</p>
		<ol>
			<li> the isolated nature of the rural areas where many of these students grew up made socialization difficult for the deaf,</li>
			<li>the atmosphere had not grown conductive for the deaf to marry, and </li>
			<li>often, family members accepted the prevailing opinion of many educators and advocates of the deaf that marriage should not be an option for the deaf individuals (Roberts, 1994). </li>
		</ol>
	<p>One of the most influential audist advocates and a eugenicist was Alexander Graham Bell. During the eugenics campaign, he aimed at discouraging the socialization, intermarriage and reproduction among the Deaf community. He attempted to get a law enacted to prohibit intermarriage among Deaf people because he was terrified of the idea that the Deaf race will be spreading. In 1883, he wrote an infamous paper entitled, “Memoirs Upon the Formation of the Deaf Variety of the Human Race” and presented against Deaf culture and Deaf intermarriage to the National Academy of Science in New Haven, Connecticut. In this paper, Bell claimed a “defective deaf race” was emerging and growing strong through the intermarriage of deaf adults, which would result in more deaf births. His concern was expressed that the deaf children who attend deaf residential schools were the growing in size, and thus spread the “defective race.” He felt at the residential schools, a deaf person would likely to marry another deaf person and somewhere along the line, as generation after generation of deaf families intermarried, there would gradually come to be a pure deaf breed of people, or in other words: a Deaf Race. Bell, therefore proposed that if the intermarriage of the deaf could be banned, then the deaf births would be unlikely to occur. He came up with two solutions: 1. Preventative method: Close all residential schools and place deaf kids in public schools with hearing kids and 2. Repressive method: Legally forbid congenitally deaf people from marrying each other when in fact, statistics indicated only 10% of deaf people have deaf parents, while 90% of deaf people have hearing parents. Furthermore, Bell’s Memoirs recommended ending the employment of deaf teachers and belittled the combined system of education, incorporating both sign and speech. The “pure” oralism was insisted. Because he shared his misleading scientifically statistics of deaf intermarriages, the law did not pass that prohibited the intermarrying of the Deaf (Lane, 1984; Behan, 1989; Lane, 1999; Lane, Hoffmeister, &#38; Bahan, 1996).</p>
		<p>When deaf education became popular in America, the social interaction of the deaf changed. More deaf individuals married. At the Utah School for the Deaf, the students were provided the opportunity to meet other deaf individuals and provided socialization skills. As the school grew, many deaf students found their spouses while attending the school. The later students benefitted from the opportunities the school gave them and their experiences became different from other older students of their families (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>In the early years of the school, several students married non-students. Several marriages occurred between staff members and students or the children of other staff members. For instance, Elizabeth DeLong, a teacher eventually married her former student, Thomas Loran Savage. The residential nature of the school allowed the students and staff members to become well acquainted and become a major place for deaf individuals to associate with other deaf people. Many marriages resulted (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>Back then, it was common for students to become deaf from various illnesses and enroll at Utah School for the Deaf. The students whose deafness occurred later tended to marry deaf individuals with hearing backgrounds while congenitally deaf persons married each other (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>During the first twenty years since its founding, nearly two-thirds of them were married. Later, the majority of students married other students who attended the school. They had the privilege to learn the vocational skills which gave them a trade allowing them often for the first time to afford to marry, live independent lives with the deaf community, and support a family (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>The Utah School for the Deaf allowed many students to meet individuals from outside the geographic areas where they resided. The school began to break down the intermarriage patterns which developed in isolated rural Utah. The following examples of breaking down the intermarriage patterns from the early students at school:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Joseph Olorenshaw came to Utah from England. His family settled in Salt Lake City but he married Helmer Mickelson, a fellow student from Largo, Idaho.</li>
			<li>Andrew Olson came to Utah from Sweden in 1870 and he married Clarissa Foote, whose family—and two other Deaf sisters—were from Salt Lake City.</li>
			<li>John McMills was born in Summit County but he married Pearl Ault whose family lived in Cedar Fort, Utah.</li>
			<li>Ole Pettit grew up in Salt Lake but his wife Jenine Jensen was originally from Salina, Utah.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Other students followed a similar pattern, while some married individuals living closer to home (Roberts, 1994, p. 38). Indeed, at least twenty-three marriages occurred between 1899 and 1914 as a result of students' interaction at both the school and the LDS Church's Deaf Mute Sunday School, held just two blocks away.</p>
		<p>Since the establishment of the deaf school, many features of deaf family life changed significantly as a result of activities at school. Students made contributions to their families, their vocations, communities and churches because of skills they learned at the school (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<h3>Students from the Same Families</h3>
		<p>According to Roberts (1994), during the first twenty-five years since the founding of Utah School for the Deaf in 1884, the students often returned to school in the next generation from the same families. After attending the USD, nieces and a cousin of the first couple got married and later attended the school at the same time. Although their children never attended the school, their relatives in both families later enrolled.</p>
		<p>Additionally, multiple members of the same family attended the USD at the same time. During the most of the early history of the school families sent cousins, like Elizabeth DeLong and John H. Clark, to school at the same time. Several sets of siblings, like Beck, Bernard, and Thompson siblings also attended the school at the same time (First Reunion of the Utah School for the Deaf Alumni, 1976; Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>While the students attended USD, faculty members encouraged students and their families to keep in touch.</p>
		<p>Most families were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and most parents of the out-of-the state students did not belong to the church. Utah parents wanted a closer school for their children while parents of the out-of-state moved their children to closer institutions when available. Despite the location of the school, families often visited the campus and participated in the activities of the school (Roberts, 1994).</p>
	<p>With the social opportunities they had at the school, the Deaf communities were eventually developed in Ogden and Salt Lake City as the students left school and reentered the larger society (Roberts, 1994). </p>
	<h3>First Deaf Pupil from Deaf Parents</h3>
		<p>A former pupil of Utah School for the Deaf, Joseph Beck, Jr.’s six years old son, Hyrum Hatch Beck who was also deaf, enrolled at this school in the fall of 1906. It was the first instance of a deaf pupil from deaf parents (The Utah Eagle, June 6, 1906). Joseph Beck, Jr. was a son of one of the co-founders, Joseph Beck of Utah School for the Deaf back in 1884.</p>
		<aside>
		<h1>Did You Know?</h1>
		<p>Emma M. Emmertson enrolled at the Utah School for the Deaf in 1903 and graduated in 1907. She was the first deaf student to enter the University of Utah in 1907 and graduate there in 1911. She later taught at the Wyoming School for the Deaf.</p>
		<p>Mary Woolslayer entered the Utah School for the Deaf in 1898 and remained there until gradation in 1907, the same class with Emma. She was the second deaf student who graduated from the University of Utah in 1914. While a student, she worked her own way through university without receiving a cent, except her pay from employing in laundry during the summer during the summer. During the winter earned her board and lodging in private family. At the university, most of Mary’s classes were lecture courses. Unlike Emma who could lip-read and speak; Mary was unable to detect words by lip reading. Through her determination, she managed to pass all of her courses and was above many other members of the class in credits (Utah Digital Newspapers, January 10, 1914). PHOTO</p>
		</aside>
		<h3>Social Development</h3>
		<p>For years, the deaf individuals made contributions to their families but they seldom became involved within the Deaf community. Upon the founding of its school in 1884, social opportunities were provided within the Deaf community. The lives of later students appeared significantly different from those who returned home as adults in the first few years of the school’s history (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>The school played a large role during its early history in the development of a sense of community among deaf individuals within the state. During the early history of the Utah School for the Deaf, socialization opportunities were offered to the students. Because the students lived at the school, they were taught to learn to get along with faculty members and other students. Adjusting to living away from home and sharing with other students was challenging to some students than others. Hence, the staff developed social activities to expose students with a variety of experiences and situations to develop their social skills. With their social skills, they were able to work with people, live and work independently, and contribute to society at large. The students were also given an opportunity to meet prominent people, gain social skills, participate in athletics and demonstrate their learning activities (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>The school provided many activities for individuals who attended the school, their families and deaf community within the state of Utah. Many social opportunities were offered for growth and interaction with others. Social activities allowed the students to interact with other students, developed the social skills, and provided chances to meet new people as well as experience challenging situations. In addition, social events allowed them to be better-rounded and be able to meet the challenges of living in a larger society (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<h4>1904 USD Students Exhibit at the World Fair</h4>
	<p>In compliance with a request of the State Board of Education, the School for the Deaf made an exhibition at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904, which formed a part of Utah's educational display. It consisted of a hexagonal plate glass cabinet containing specimens of work from the domestic science classes, carpenter, shoe, and blacksmith shops. The frames were filled with photographs of the buildings, compositions, lessons, printing and fancy work (Pace, 1946).</p>
		<p>A third year oral class of five children, a teacher, and supervisor were sent to the fair. They were at the exposition eight weeks in August and September and formed a part of the Model School for the Deaf and Blind in the Palace of Education. The work of this "Live Exhibit" proved to be one of Utah's best displays. The exposition authorities awarded the Utah School for the Deaf a gold medal and a copy of a certificate of grand prize for its exhibits at the Fair (Pace, 1946).</p>
		<p>In 1905, a similar exhibit of a cabinet and frames with examples of pupils work was entered as a part of Utah's Educational Institutions in the Utah Building at the Lewis and Clark Exposition Demonstrations, with pupils from the school, were given daily during the month of August, in the methods of teaching the deaf to speak and read lips. The school was awarded a gold medal for its entries at this Fair (Pace, 1946).</p>
		<p>The school made a small exhibit of school and shop work at the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition held at Seattle in 1910. For the excellence of the display a silver medal was awarded (Pace, 1946).</p>
		<h4>Social Interests among Boys and Girls</h4>
	<p>In 1921, there were one hundred and twenty-six boys and girls at the Utah School for the Deaf, forty-two in Primary Hall and eighty-four in the Main Building.

			At that time, the boys were attracted to war. The school had veterans who served in “wars” and some of them had “scars.” They had many interesting stories to tell. The young boys had divided into groups and were always at war with each other.

			Arthur Wenger, USD ’13, shared that while visiting the USD, he often encountered a boy who was slumped over depression about something and would act “violent” when disturbed. It was discovered that the boy was a “defeated general” and he either lost the war or was concerned about the safety of his troop when victory was doubtful.</p>
		<p>Several Indian wars were held as well. One scene of the “world war” was located at the Ogden River where the boys utilized trenches, machine guns, cudgels, swords, and helmets of padded kitchen utensils while at war with each other. The air was thick with burst of dirt, corks, and all kind of projectiles. There were bold encounters and even the dead were trampled on. One of the “dead” kicked a passing enemy and they both “died” together, kidding each other.</p>
		<p>While the older boys were playing baseball, the young boys were “drafted” by the “generals” and baseball suffered. The older boys appealed to the generals in a brotherly manner for the release of the “drafted” baseball players. The appeal was rejected so the “big guys” threatened to bring an end to the war. The armies were discharged and the young boys dropped the rocks to support the baseball.</p>
		<p>The girls, on the other hand, were always playing out-of-doors and dancing circle. There were storytelling such as “Peter Pan” and he was always the center of a merry whirl. “Princess” was also a great story teller. A girl was given complementary name for her leadership in some of the activities (Wenger, The Silent Worker, January 1921).</p>
		<h4>Swimming Pool Fun</h4>
	<p>A swimming pool was filled with fresh water every week and was opened to all groups on scheduled time. The swimmers were allowed to raise their voice as loud as they could. There were excitements and enthusiasms from the boys and girls. This would allow them to vent which could help control tempers/fights later on (Wenger, The Silent Worker, January 1921).</p>
		<h4>The Burdett’s Picnic and Boating Party</h4>
	<p>Kay Kinner, class of 1954 published her article entitled, “The Burdett’s Picnic and Boating Party” in the Utah Eagle magazine. Kenneth C. Burdett, a Deaf teacher and inspirational youth leader invited the Utah School for the Deaf high school students to picnic and boating party during the summer of 1953 and had a blast. Kay wrote: </p>
<blockquote>
			<p>During the summer of 1953, it was so hot that the Utah School for the Deaf high school students always drank lemonades or cold drinks. The lawns and plants were dry because they had so few showers. However, sometime there was a little rain at night, but not during he day They surely had a hard time watering the plants, lawns, and flowers so they would grow beautifully. Those that had jobs came home, and watered in the evening. They went swimming often to get cool.</p>
			<p>They received invitations from the Burdetts to go boating and picnicking on the 2nd of August. They were so excited and even some girls and boys who lived far away from Ogden, were invited. Some of them came to Ogden so they might go to Pine View Lake together the Sunday after Peter’s and Sally’s wedding.</p>
			<p>The day began cold and rainy and they thought that they might not be able to go there. While they stayed at the Burdett’s home, they waited and waited for the rain to stop. Suddenly, the rain stopped and the sun shone very brightly about noon. They thought the weather was queer. When the sun shone through the window onto the floor they were ready, and started for the Pine View Lake.</p>
			<p>Some of them went water skiing, and surf boarding. Some of the girls and boys went riding in the boat with Kenneth Burdett. Kenneth Kinner held onto the rope and went water skiing. They were nonplussed that Max Hardy could water ski and ride a surfboard. He just held onto the rope and rode the waves, then went water skiing at once. He was successful although that was his first time. Von Jones, Done Mae Dekker, Lawana Simmons, and Bruce Harvey tried to learn how to control themselves water skiing. Some fell down all the time, but some of them were successful. Dixie Lee Larsen and Kay Kinner water-skied well because they had done this before at Bear Lake. They had fun going water skiing and surf riding.</p>
			<p>At the beach, they rested and the Burdetts treated them to cold drinks. They took sunbaths for a while. They had fun going water skiing and surf riding. They fell and tried to manage themselves.</p>

It was all very interesting for them. Marion Brown and her boy friend were with them – Kay Kinner (Kinner, The Utah Eagle, October 1953). [PHOTO] </p>

		<h4>Extra-Curricular Activities</h4>
		<p>As mentioned in Part III, Utah School for the Deaf alumni reported in the 1976 and 1984 USD Reunion Booklets that the students had the opportunity to participate in extra-curricular activities after school. They seemed to be happy and well-adjusted and learned how to use time and participated in many activities during the weekends. These activities were Park Literary Society, Arthur Wenger Athletic Association, Drama Club, Spur Club, Ski Club, Student Body Government, Jr. NAD, Student Council, Athletic Program, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. Most of them attended the L.D.S Branch for the Deaf on Sundays and Tuesday nights to participate in all kinds of services. Others attended the Protestant Chapel services (First Reunion of the Utah School for the Deaf Alumni, 1976; A Century of Memories: Utah School for the Deaf 100th Year Anniversary Alumni Reunion Booklet, 1984).</p>
	<p>The three main clubs on the campus were: Park Literary Society, Arthur Wenger Athletic Association, and Spur Club.</p>
	<h4>The Park Literary Society</h4>
	<p>In 1897, the faculty members of Utah School for the Deaf organized a Park Literary Society. This society was named in honor of John R. Park, President of the University of Deseret, at the time the school for the deaf was a department of the University. It was the oldest club on the campus having been founded soon after the establishment of the school (Roberts, 1994).</p>
	<p>The society was composed of boys and girls over fourteen years old of age. The literary meetings were held every two weeks throughout the school year. The purpose of the society was two-fold: To encourage creative activities: e.g., dramatic and writing among the pupils, and to deepen their appreciation of good literature (Roberts, 1994).</p>
	<p>The students were given opportunity to debate various subjects; some serious and others whimsical, or discussed literary works. The students had to prepare their talks, stories, plays and debates themselves without the help of their teachers (Roberts, 1994).</p>
	<p>Several questions for debate found in the “Eaglets” were resolved: “That Lincoln was a greater Man than Washington, “That the United States should recognize the independence of Cuba,” “That boys have more pleasure than girls.” “Our boys and girls of today are missing out on a great experience like that.” The teachers and members of the Deaf community were appointed as judges of the debates and decided who win the debate (Roberts, 1994; First Reunion of the Utah School for the Deaf Alumni, 1976; A Century of Memories: Utah School for the Deaf 100th Year Anniversary Alumni Reunion Booklet, 1984).</p>
	<p>The most ambitious and successful theatrical production ever attempted by the deaf in Utah was the “House of Rimmon” presented by the Park Literary Society in 1920 at the Utah School for the Deaf. The play was based on a Biblical theme. Two deaf individuals, Arthur Wenger was the director and Elsie Christiansen was an assistant. Thirty-five members were in the cast and rest of them was wearing make-up for the play. This play was two months in preparation and the rehearsal scenes were an amusing sight. It was hard work with equal amount of fun. The play was given in the school chapel once and repeated at East High School in Salt Lake City on request. The general excellence of the performance won great applause from the audience. The public were given a better understanding of what the deaf was capable of and no admission was charged (White. The Silent Worker, June 1920; Wenger, The Silent Worker, January 1921; UAD Bulletin, Summer 1964). [PHOTO – UAD Bulletin, Summer 1964, p. 5]</p>
	<p>These activities created friendships which became the basis of the later organization of the deaf groups in Utah and Idaho. Probably for the first time, the school provided a sense of community for these deaf individuals that later grew into the deaf organizations providing support and social activities for these people (Roberts, 1994).</p>
	<h3>The Arthur Wenger Athletic Association</h3>
	<p>The Arthur Wenger Athletic Association was a club for the older boys. It was founded by and named for one of the school's outstanding graduates, Arthur Wenger. It had been in existence for nearly thirty years (1915-16?). The purpose of this club was to promote social development and good fellowship among the boys through participation in athletic activities (Roberts, 1994).</p>
	<h3>The Spur Club</h3>
	<p>The Spur Club, a new organization for older girls, was active in sponsoring school activities and good will.</p>
	<p>Besides the clubs, a formal banquet was held annually to honor students whose service to the Utah School for the Deaf had been exceptional.</p>
	<p>Troops of Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts were active in their respective programs and activities (Roberts, 1994). </p>

		<h1>Did You Know?</h1>
		<p>Dr. John R. Park was one of the greatest benefactors by the deaf of Utah. In 1884, when the Legislature of the then Territory of Utah was solicited by two parents of deaf children, John Beck and William Wood to establish a state school for the deaf, the Legislature complied with their request. They placed the work in the hands of Dr. Park, then President of the Territorial University. Dr. Park made arrangements for starting a class for deaf students in connection with the University and employed a deaf individual, Henry C. White of Boston to take charge of such class.</p>
		<p>Dr. Park always showed his great interest in this work. When the industrial training was established in connection with the school, he gave the first material. The material consisted of the press upon which the first issues of this paper were printed. A large portion of the type was used in setting the forms.</p>
		<p>Dr. Park was the head of the Utah School for the Deaf for eight years. He early realized that the school should be independent of the University. He used his influence to accomplish the greatest measure of that direction. When the school became a separate institution and was located in Ogden, no one rejoiced more than he.</p>
		<p>When Dr. Park visited the USD in Ogden, he was a guest. He was remembered by pupils on that occasion. Shortly before his death, USD staff visited him in his office in Salt Lake City, he still showed the same lively interest in the welfare of the school.</p>
		<p>Dr. Park was President of the University of the Territory and State for nearly 25 years. He was born in 1835 and passed away on September 30, 1900 (Metcalf, The Utah Eagle, October 15, 1900; The Utah Eagle, October 15, 1900).</p>

			<h3>The Annual May Festival</h3>
		<p>In 1909 the May Festival was first held. During the festivals, the students presented their dance recital in great interest and beauty where a large crowd was usually in attendance. One time, five thousand people watched the performance. The annual festival lasted until 1936.</p>
			<p>The most successful pageant of the Ninth Annual May Festival was “The Story of the Deaf.” This pageant was held at the Utah School for the Deaf campus and repeated on the lawn of Liberty Park in Salt Lake City in May 1920. All children arrayed themselves in characteristics costumes of all nationalities and portrayed the struggle of the Deaf, against intolerance and neglect to a position of happiness and achievement through the blessings of education.</p>
			<p>The solo dancers were Mona Leckliter, Vida Crawford, Elsie Lamb, Gladys Jones, and Corline Wood. Arthur Wenger, USD alumni reported that these dancers were beautifully acted a part in five senses, Sight, Taste, Touch, Smell, and Hearing. While the senses were dancing, several girls entered seeking the blessings of the five senses which were presented as a gift upon them. The girls and the senses danced together with joy and gratitude. Hearing strayed away from her companions and was lost. Edna Wright in the role of “The Maiden” represented as “Deaf” came to beg eagerly for the blessings of the five senses. Only four of the Senses were able to honor with their blessings. When the “Maiden” noticed that she lacked hearing, she was sad, but the Knowledge came to her assistance and called upon nature in the form of butterflies, birds and flowers to aid her. The Deaf girl was happy. The pageant represented the long story of the struggle and appeal of the Deaf for recognition of their rights.</p>
			<p>Wenger then shared that the transition through the episodes of the different nations was a succession disappointment until finally in the American Episode, the “Maiden” rose from the folds of the Starts and Stripes. She gave freedom, equity and prosperity upon all. Her graceful dancing and genuine expression touched the viewers who were enthusiastic over her and all of the children who supported her.</p>
			<p>After the pageant, three following commended letters were sent to Frank M. Driggs, superintendent of Utah School for the Deaf (The Silent Worker, January 1921). </p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>May 27, 1920</p>
				<p>Frank M. Driggs, Principal<br>Utah School for the Deaf and Blind<br>Ogden, Utah</p>
		<p>Dear Mr. Driggs – Last Monday I was privileged to witness the pageant staged by the girls and boys of your institution on the greensward within your grounds, under the direction of yourself and your efficient corps of instructors.</p>
				<p>I have seen other pageants in other part of the land but never before have I been so enthralled by any conception, by any inspiration as I was by THE STORY OF THE DEAF! The realistic presentation of the prologue sent shivers coursing up and down my body, like those wild animals have when brought face to face with overpowering manifestations of subjective influences. Shall I admit it to you? Tears filled my eyes! They ran unheeded down my face in a stream until suddenly I was brought back to material cognizance and surreptitiously wiped them away.</p>
				<p>I cannot tell you at this time about all the emotions which swept me almost off my seat as I saw prologue and episode pass all too swiftly before my eyes. Then as I lost myself in the person of the MAIDEN, EDNA WRIGHT, seeking the misplaced sense. I was overcome by the prodigiousness of the quest. I discovered myself with her, ransacking the known Universe for relief, -- and still I went unrewarded! The overpowering sensibility of real loss, with her, bore me to earth.</p>
				<p>So artistically, so vividly, were the episodes of the pageant presented that I was transported for the while, reveled with those girls and boys in other realize, those of subjective vision and dreamed of the day when mankind should return to subjective control and live untrammeled physical and spiritual lives – in the perfection of physical and spiritual development. And as I dreamed I realized the compensatory development which each one, especially the older ones exhibited in their lack of one sense!</p>
				<p>Consolation came out to her or to me until individuals like yourself, Mrs. Ross and those who labor in the cause of subjective development, yield their lives to SERVICE to humans who sought relief and release from overwhelming, living, defeat and arose to their own station in life acceptable citizens, capable, loving, interested and ethcieut!</p>
				<p>As expancuts of the highest attainable art in such miraculous application to idealism, you and your able assistance are deserving of great praise. Sweet, idealistic, co-ordinate expression of the beautiful in rhythm was surely exemplified in last Monday’s performance!</p>
				<p>Will you please express Mrs. Rose and her assistants my great appreciation of her exceedingly artistic direction of every episode in that wonderful spectacle? Tell her also that I acknowledge the attainment of her objective in terms of the highest possible praise.</p>
				<p>Say as well to those dear girls and boys who gave such a realistic expression of their own individualities in every movement that my pleasure was unbounded. That I am certain that their devotion to the attainment of an efficiency which will carry them through life with hearts of great thankfulness, will not only please their instructors and themselves, but GOD as well will be satisfied with the attempt they are making to do for themselves what HE expects them to accomplish!</p>
				<p>Finally, Sir, my hat is off to you! That one man may so devotedly and so quietly serve his fellows as you are doing deserves commendation of the highest order. May you continue to raise up ideals which shall hear the fullness of the day’s inspection, and so long as you direct, may you direct with precision, with power and with an abiding faith in your own ability to erect about you substantialities which shall become a monument to you when you shall have passed on to your great reward!</p>
				<p>Yours with kindest regards,</p>
				<p>Chris G. Plummer.</p>

				<p>Supt. F. M. Driggs,<br>School for Blind and Deaf,<br>Ogden, Utah</p>
				<p>Dear Supt. Driggs – The pageant by your pupils at the park so impressed me that I must say a word of praise.</p>
				<p>I think I can realize somewhat the “shot-in” condition of your wards, and it has always seemed so difficult to me to break through this barricade of defectiveness. Consequently, when one has brought so much emotional life and joy as you seem to have to these children, he must feel as God, that he has created, and it is very good.</p>
				<p>Money cannot pay for such service. There is an added debt of gratitude. May I tender you this in part payment of my share.</p>

			<p>Words fail me when I attempt to express the feeling of appreciation in my heart which I have for the indefatigable labors which you and your Staff have shown in the education of these precious souls. There must be a great amount of joy and comfort that comes to your heart when you see those children have given to them, education, thru the channels which you pursue. How happy their lives must be when they can learn to appreciate and enjoy life thru the median of your good efforts. How are more glorious is life to them to those who never have such an opportunity. All praise to you for your good efforts. May you be continually blessed in your endeavors.</p>

		<h3>Holiday Celebrations at the School</h3>
		<p>During the early history of the Utah School for the Deaf, holidays played a large part in the social activities at the school. The students remained at school during Thanksgiving and usually went home only for the Christmas holidays. The Protestant chapel services provided a large Thanksgiving dinner. Games and nature walks took place in the afternoon (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>During the Christmas program, Santa always visited the school before the students went home for the holidays. Since many parents came to pick their children up for the holidays, the Christmas program allowed the parents to see them perform (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>Other holiday events were also celebrated at school. The faculty planned Arbor Day activities, Valentine socials, and other holiday events. On one Easter, the Easter bunny provided treats and the students had fun wondering where he went and whether he would visit again (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>Other social events took place during the school year. Superintendent Metcalf and faculty sponsored a masquerade dance and other events. Often in the spring and fall, he held join faculty and adult student socials where the faculty and students socialized together. Several marriages resulted between individuals who attend these social functions (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>Since most students lived at the school birthdays, celebrations became very important. Birthday parties for both faculty and students occurred. On several occasions, the Metcalf children invited many students to their birthday parties (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>Years later, most of the deaf students went home for Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<h3>School Outings and Excursions</h3>
		<p>The Utah School for the Deaf provided a variety of outings for the students. Before the USD moved to Ogden, they took a trip to the circus and again after the USD relocated in Ogden (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>The students participated in winter activities of sledding and ice skating. While the students lived in Salt Lake City, they often went sledding on the hills between the school and the area that eventually became Utah’s Capitol, commonly referred to as Capitol Hill. After the school moved to Ogden, the gardener maintained an ice rink on the property for most years where the students can enjoy ice skating (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>John Beck, a co-founder of the Utah School for the Deaf, owned a hot springs north of the school in Salt Lake City. His three sons, Joseph, John A., and Jacob and other older boys took numerous outings to that location before the school moved to Ogden (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>On other occasions, staff members and students went on nature walks, and shopping trips. These excursions provided teaching opportunities as well as giving a change of surroundings for students and staff (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>One of the trips to the canyon, the students met Dr. James Talmage, a professor at the University of Utah and he had a blind brother, Albert who also attended the Utah School for the Blind. He knew some of the students because of his association with the school while it was affiliated with the University of Utah. As recorded in the Utah Eagle, 1900-1901, the outing took place at the Ogden Canyon.</p>
		<p>Some of the large boys went up to the mouth of Ogden Canyon with Mr. Crandall the other day. They wanted to look at the bridge which was recently destroyed by a rock falling from the immense cliff at the mouth of the canyon. They met Dr. Talmage, formerly president of the University of Utah. He was to examine the tunnel, the cliff, the fissure and the water pipe and report to the electric Power Plant Company regarding the cause of the break and the proper course to pursue to repair the damage done. Dr. Talmage is a learned geologist and a very prominent scientist.</p>
		<p>Several other influential people also visited the Utah School for the Deaf and befriended the students. One of the influential people, David Oman McKay often visited the school while teaching the high school level at Weber Stake Academy and serving in the state legislature. He later became the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>The actress Maud May Babcock served as a member of the school’s board of trustee for twenty-two years. In 1904, she made a trip to the east to study the methods of other schools. She later lobbied for more funding for new programs at the school. She frequently visited the school and shared the experience with the students (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>Edwin A. Stratford served as the chairman of the board of trustees for several years and he exchanged his concerns for the students. He was appointed to join the board after the school separated from the University of Utah and relocated to Ogden (Roberts, 1994). The bishop of the Latter-day Saints' Ogden Fourth Ward, Stratford also served as the superintendent of the Church's Deaf-Mute Sunday School from 1896 until his death in 1899.</p>
		<p>Ultimately, these four individuals as well as others greatly influenced the students at the USD and promoted their interests of the school among their friends and in the state of legislature (Roberts, 1994).</p>

			<h1>Did You Know?</h1>
			<p>Maud May Babcock was known as the Utah’s first lady of the theater and of physical education. As a first female member of the University of Utah's faculty, she founded the Departments of Speech and of Physical Education at the University of Utah. Also, as an actress, she established the University Theater, originated the first college dramatic club in the United States. Under her direction, the University of Utah was the first university in the country to produce a stage play called, "Eleusinia." During her lifetime, she personally produced more than 300 plays and directed 800 plays. Currently, a theatre is named after her – “Babcock Theatre.”</p>

		<h3>Legislative Leadership Opportunity</h3>
		<p>The school administrators at Utah School for the Deaf provided students’ leadership opportunity to students in lobbying the legislature and included the activities designed to build support for the school. The activities the students learned were fund raising and appeals, first to the territorial legislature, and later the state legislature for funds to develop the school and its programs. While the school was in Salt Lake City, the students received invitations to the territorial legislature. After the school moved to Ogden, the state legislators visited the school there (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>The faculty organized a yearly ‘exhibition’ program to demonstrate the students’ accomplishments and invited the legislators to observe the skills of the students. The students were given an opportunity to interact with hearing individuals and to demonstrate their accomplishments and value of the school’s program. The benefit of the program was to build students’ self-confidence (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>An example of an exhibition was given for the state legislature in January 1896 where students demonstrated their educational skills and gave a demonstration of songs and recitation of memorized readings as well as poetry. In addition to the part of the exhibition, the students took a tour at the Utah State Capitol building to learn how the legislative process worked. They even met many of the governmental leaders. They learned the functions of government such as the Legislative (House &#38; Senate), Executive (Governor), and Judicial (Courts) branches of government. The tour exposed the students to many experiences that their parents may never have experienced (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>With the legislative leadership skills they learned at school, many became leaders within the state. They contributed their leadership skills to the Utah Association for the Deaf to cover the areas of advocacy including anti-peddlers, traffic safety, early intervention, education, employment, rehabilitation, insurance, health care, technology, telecommunications, youth leadership, and more.</p>
		<h3>Helen Keller Visits the Utah School for the Deaf and the Blind</h3>
		<p>On March 14, 1941, Helen Keller, the famous deaf and blind woman visited the Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind. She was accompanied by Polly Thomason, her companion and official interpreter and Ida Hirst-Gifford, her business manager. Before she visited the USDB, she came to Utah under the auspices of the American Foundation for the Blind and appeared before the legislature in the interest of the adult blind. She addressed an audience of 5000 deeply interested people in the Mormon Tabernacle.</p>
		<p>At USDB, Helen spoke in the chapel of the Main Building where the students surrounded to listen to her remarks while Frank Driggs, superintendent assisted with interpreting. Helen’s interpreter, Polly used two means of communication with her, speech and the manual alphabet. When requested to ask a question spelled into Helen’s hand, he asked, “What is the most outstanding thing you have found in your visit to Utah?” Her immediate reply was, “The good will toward the adult blind” (The Utah Eagle, March 1941).

			<h5><strong>Editor's note</strong>: much of the information about the establishment of sunday schools and congregations of Deaf Latter-day Saints is based on Elaine Roberts' 1994 masters thesis "The Early History of the Utah School for the Deaf and its Influence in the Development of a Cohesive Deaf society in Utah, c. 1884–1905." However, due to recent research by Stringham &#38; Leahy (in progess), much of Roberts' writings in this area are either incomplete or questionable and are rapidly subject to change.</h5>
		</div>
		<h3>A Sunday School is Organized for Deaf Latter-day Saint Students and Members</h3>
		<p>As part of the curriculum to include activities at the Utah School for the Deaf, the faculty organized and conducted a daily non-denominational chapel service in the early morning before the class began. Based on Protestant emphasis, these services were to design to instruct moral principles and value. However, several Latter-day Saints parents feared with the Protestant influence on their children. Not all of them thought the Protestant emphasis desirable and hence, some parents expressed their concerns about it (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>Parents’ concerns led the involvement of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for observation. In April 1891, Elder Thomas C. Griggs, superintendent of the Salt Lake City Deseret Sunday School Union Board, was appointed to investigate the possibility of organizing a Sunday School to see if the members of the school were willing to attend. It was discovered that a number of children of Latter-day Saints might be benefitted by receiving religious instruction in a Sunday School. The consent of the Board of Regents of the University of Utah and of the parents of the children were obtained (Jubilee History of Latter-day Saints Sunday Schools, 1849-1899).</p>
		<p>On January 10, 1892, Superintendent Griggs organized the Deaf-Mute Sunday School in Salt Lake City with a membership of eleven boys and sixteen girls (Jubilee History of Latter-day Saints Sunday Schools. 1849-1899). The Sunday School first met in the Salt Lake Nineteenth Ward Relief Society building where USD Principal Frank Metcalf kindly assisted as a sign language interpreter. The school was afterwards moved to the Latter-day Saints’ College building, on the First North Street, Salt Lake City (The Daily Enquirer, Feb. 11, 1892). They met on Sunday afternoon and the Latter-day Saints services supplemented the Protestant services which remained mandatory for all students (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>There, Elder H.C. Barrell was appointed as first Superintendent of Sunday School with Elder Laron Pratt as his assistant. Brother Barrell had to use the blackboard to communicate with the deaf. Brother Pratt was deaf and knew sign language well. He also had good speech and lip reading abilities. He was thus able to render invaluable assistance. Brother Pratt acted as secretary and both he and Brother Barrell were teachers (The Utah Eagle, March 1917). The Sunday School was conducted by these officers during the school term each year until the school was moved to Ogden in 1896.</p>
		<h3>The Sunday School Moves to Ogden</h3>
		<p>When Utah School for the Deaf relocated in Ogden, Utah, the same Sunday School organization continued to function where it was held in the old fourth Ward Amusement Hall.</p>
		<p>On November 16, 1896, a Sunday School was offered for the deaf and blind who attended the Utah Schools for Deaf and the Blind where Edwin A. Stratford was appointed to take charge as superintendent, with George Seaman as first assistant and Laron Pratt as second assistant  (Jubilee History of Latter-day Saints Sunday Schools. 1849-1899). At this time, Mr. Stratford was serving as the president of the board of trustee of the Utah School for the Deaf-Mutes and the Blind (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>Amy Devine, Andrew Madsen, and John H. Clark, also the students at USD, were asked to be the first teachers in the newly-relocated Sunday School, undoubtedly because of their proficiency in the sign language and other qualifications (Deseret News, Nov. 21, 1896).</p>
		<h3>The L.D.S. Branch for the Deaf</h3>
		<p>Over the years, a few Sunday Schools were organized serving the deaf population in Utah. In 1896, a Sunday School at the Ogden Fourth Ward was offered for students boarding at the newly-relocated school for the deaf at Ogden. This ward supervised and sponsored the church activities for the Utah School for the Deaf. Not all LDS students attended the Sunday Schools, but they along with LDS students provided the basis of additional programs later organized for the deaf by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, including branches, wards, and later sign language missionaries in many missions of the church (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>Max W. Woodbury, the then-serving Sunday School superintendent was asked by Ogden Stake President XXX XXXX to serve as the first president of the L.D.S Branch for the Deaf in February 1917. Woodbury asked D. J. Thurman (a teacher of the blind at USD) and Otto Farley to serve as counselors, and Elsie M. Christiansen, to serve as branch clerk. Their chapel was built on the corner of 21st Street and Liberty Avenue and was located one and one half blocks from the USD campus. The Ogden Branch for the Deaf was a suitable place of worship solely for the use of the deaf members. Since its establishment in 1917, the church played a huge part in the Deaf community in the state of Utah.</p>
		<p>Because of where the Utah School for the Deaf was located, a large number of deaf residents lived in Ogden. By 1920, almost twenty-five percent of the pupils of Utah School for the Deaf were Latter-day Saints. With such a large number, it was necessary to have some place where they have social gathering as well as religious meetings (White, The Silent Worker, October 1920).</p>
		<p>The L.D.S. (later renamed Ogden) Branch for the Deaf was the first template of future branches and wards for the deaf in the LDS Church. Later branches such as the </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Salt Lake Valley Branch for the Deaf (1948)</li>
			<li>Southern California Branch for the Deaf (1952)</li>
			<li>Northern California Branch for the Deaf (1958)</li>
			<li>Provo Deaf Branch (1967)</li>
			<li>Jungang Nonga Deaf Branch (Korea; 1980)</li>
			<li>Fremont Deaf Branch (1982)</li>
			<li>Chicago Deaf Branch (1983)</li>
			<li>Gooding Deaf Branch (1985)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>and others were eventually organized and expanded in Utah and all over the United States as well as around the world such as Canada, England, and Scotland (Walker, 2006).</p>
	<p>The Board of Trustees in their Biennial Report to the Governor included the following statement:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The location of the school in Ogden has congregated a number of deaf and blind in that city, which together with the school population, make quite a colony. To provide for the religious training of those among them, who are Latter-Day Saints, the authorities of that church have built a beautiful chapel, costing $13,500, one and one-half blocks from the school. We believe this is the first religious organization in the world to construct a place of worship for the exclusive use of the deaf and blind.</p>
			<p>While this chapel was not a part of the school, it contributed so much to the lives of the children over a long period of years. Students of various faiths were encouraged to participate in their church activities. A majority of the older deaf pupils attended services at the L.D.S Branch for the Deaf on Sunday mornings and evenings. Mutual Improvement Association meetings (a young people's organization) were held Tuesday evenings. The younger pupils of the school begun each school day with a short prayer and a Sunday School class was given on the campus each Sunday afternoon by a regular member of the teaching staff of the primary department (Pace, 1946).</p>
		</blockquote>
	<p>In October 1920, an author and non-LDS member, Bob White of The Silent Worker magazine, visiting Ogden from Colorado Springs, noticed that the deaf of the LDS faith were more devout in their religious work, and took greater interest in their gatherings. In his Ogden’s Social and Religious Center article, he stated that LDS deaf members were just like other people, as he found them to be very courteous and always striving to make the stranger to feel at home (White, The Silent Worker, October 1920).</p>
