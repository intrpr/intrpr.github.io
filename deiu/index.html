	<h3>Acknowledgment</h3>
	<p>I am highly indebted to a number of people who were integral to the completion of this project. I am grateful to all of them for their support and contribution to make this project happen. First and foremost, I want to thank my husband, Duane and my children, Joshua and Danielle for their endless patience with my obsession throughout this book project over the past five years. This book has been a long time in the making, and would not have been possible without the help of many people. I would like to show my deep sense of gratitude and appreciation to my father-in-law, Kenneth L. Kinner for sharing the story of Utah’s deaf education with me. Without his encouragement and guidance, this project would not have materialized.</p>
	<p>I wish to express my gratitude to Dr. Robert G. Sanderson for inspiring me to do my homework to make this project happen. I also gratefully acknowledge the enthusiastic support from Dave Mortensen and Eleanor McCowan while working on the project. I also wanted to thank my parents, John and Jeanne Becker for being my cheerleader in completing this project. I would like to show my greatest appreciation to Lisa Roush and Kleda Quigley for their valuable guidance and support. While compiling the large amount of historical information, I wanted to express my deeply appreciation to Julie Smith for her assistance to “unstick my stuck” in the writing and thinking process. Apart from my own efforts, I wanted to extend my sincerest thanks and appreciation to three team editors, Valarie Kinney, Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz, and Bronwyn O’Hara for donating their time revising and editing this document. My heartfelt appreciation goes to my book editor, Doug Stringham’s contribution to editing. Finally, I wanted to thank Doug Stringham for sharing the version of the book with Dr. Bryan K. Eldredge and making a senior level "special topics" class called "Deaf Education in Utah” possible at Utah Valley University.</p>
	<p>After working on this book project, I have gained deep respect and appreciation for the Utah Association of the Deaf and their campaigning vigorously, tirelessly for the better education and services of the deaf. The key people are included in the document so their names can be remembered and honored. My hats off to UAD and the key people! It is not intentional to make Utah School for the Deaf or particular parties look bad, but to help give a clear picture of what happened historically from the eyes of the Deaf community and their allies, including hearing parents of deaf children. The history of Deaf education in Utah has never been recorded from a Deaf perspective and it should be a very valued perspective. As Robert Heinlein stated, “A generation which ignores history has no past and no future,” it is vital for us to be aware of a long history of political controversy over the circumstances surrounding the inequality of Deaf Education that existed in Utah to become better advocate for deaf children’s rights to language and communication. &#8212;Jodi B. Kinner</p>
