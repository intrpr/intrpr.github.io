		<h2>Chapter 2: <br>The Influence Of Utah School for the Deaf and The L.D.S. Branch for the Deaf in the Early Development of a Cohesive Deaf Society in Utah</h2>
		<h1>Part II —  Parallel Difficulties in the Latter-day Saint Community and the Utah School for the Deaf, 1961–1980</h1>
		<h3>The Ogden LDS Branch for the Deaf Faces Trials and Tribulations</h3>
		<p>Fast forward to the year of 1961, Boyd E. Packer, Chairman of the Church Educational Department with Kenneth Sheffield over the Weber County area, organized the first seminary class for the deaf members who attended the Utah School for the Deaf in its history. A new seminary class was formed at the Ogden Branch for the Deaf. It was the first instruction designed for deaf students of that faith and it was taught in sign language. The class was held five days a week and they met every morning from 7:30 to 8:30 AM. Attendance was strictly on a voluntary basis. G. Leon Curtis was an instructor while Kenneth Kinner assisted. Thirty-two students were enrolled (Curtis, The Utah Eagle, October 1961).</p>
		<p>In 1968, President Curtis became a principal of the Deaf Seminary classes assisted by J. Wayne Noble and Stephen Mecham. Under the direction of President Curtis, the Gospel was taught in three different classes – oral, sign language, and Braille. About 15 students enrolled in each class and the classes were still held at the Branch.</p>
		<p>After the release of President Curtis from his church calling due to his relocation to Arizona to complete his master’s degree, Boyd E. Packer became one of the twelve Apostles for the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, President Kinner was called to be branch president. He faced unexpected challenges and tribulations when Dr. Grant B. Bitter became a coordinator for the Deaf Seminary for the State of Utah under the direction of William E. Berret, Administrator of Seminaries and Institutes of Religion in 1970 and 1971. There, Dr. Bitter called seven oral trained teachers from the Utah School for the Deaf to teach seven oral seminary classes. Boyd Neilson, a coordinator of the Oral Department at USD, was appointed by Dr. Bitter as principal of the deaf seminary classes. Only one sign language seminary class was offered and it was taught by a deaf member, Lola Elizabeth Jensen, wife of a Utah School for the Deaf teacher, Don Jensen.</p>
		<p>When the “Y” system was formed at the Utah School for the Deaf in 1962 requiring the deaf students to initially enter the oral program, the oral deaf members still attended the Branch to learn the Gospel in sign language. However, Dr. Bitter, Boyd Neilsen, and the oral teachers frowned at them for attending its services as well as activities. They attempted to gain control of the Branch and to ban sign language, especially in the seminary classes. They even tried to prevent the oral deaf members from participating in the Branch’s mutual activities. Social gatherings were an important aspect of the branch. When the oral seminary classes were offered to participate in the Branch’s regular activities, the oral teachers flatly refused in fear that the oral deaf students would learn to sign. Two separate activities were provided for oral and sign, similar to what happened on the USD campus.</p>
		<p>During the seminary class, the members had a testimony meeting about what they had learned in the class every Wednesday morning before school started. Somehow, the signing members stood on the stage to bear testimony in sign language. All oral members unexpectedly followed and bearded testimony in sign language. They were filled with joy. However, it greatly disturbed the oral teachers. The next month, the oral teachers decided to stand on the step before the pulpit. When the members approached the pulpit, they would remind them not to sign. Sharing testimony eventually dwindled down.</p>
		<p>Ironically, the Branch was dedicated by President Joseph F. Smith honoring the current and future attendance of the USD students in 1917. For instance, a small water fountain was originally built designated for children. Dr. Bitter, Boyd Neilson and the oral teachers felt the Branch isolated itself from the hearing world. They hoped that a purely oral education at USD and church would lead to greater assimilation of the deaf population into the majority, hearing population. Furthermore, they wished for them to attend their local hearing family’s wards. One Sunday evening, Boyd Neilsen called all local bishops to attend the Branch for training in preparation for the oral deaf memberships being transferred to their home ward. Their goal was for the local church to provide an oral interpreter in the services. The training continued, but no evidence of success. They remained at the Branch.</p>
		<p>For many years, the Branch was operating peacefully under the direction of Branch President Woodbury and the young deaf members were given an opportunity to obtain leadership in their church callings. In 1964, Branch President Kinner moved to Ogden from Bountiful and became a secretary of the Aaronic Priesthood class with an enrollment of 22 boys from USD When he became a 1st Counselor with Branch President Curtis in 1968, President Woodbury cautioned them about the oral movement being implemented at USD and the possibility of affecting the Branch as well.</p>
		<p>Exactly what Branch President Woodbury anticipated, a few years after his released from his calling, the Branch Presidency faced an interruption of regular procedures and peace in the Branch. They were battling with the oral advocates’ attempt at planting an oral influence in the Branch. Dr. Bitter, Boyd Neilsen, and the oral teachers wouldn’t leave the Branch alone. It raised conflict among the two parties over communication methodology as well as philosophy and taking control of the Branch and the Seminary classes.</p>
		<p>With all things going on with the Branch and Seminar, the Stake President Gunn McKay received a letter from the Branch Presidency asking for intervention. He empathized with the Branch’s battle and was on their side. A meeting was called where Branch President Kinner with his interpreter Lucy Greenwood, Dr. Bitter, and Boyd Neilsen gathered to solve the conflicting issues. However, the meeting was cut short as Stake President McKay had another meeting to attend. He could help solve the problems, but he won as a congressman and moved to Washington, D.C. Stake President Keith Jensen replaced Gunn McKay and was aware of the Branch’s struggle, but he did not know what to do.</p>
		<p>The battle continued. Branch President Kinner and 1st Counselor Cochran were still concerned about the interference with religious services and activities. Bishop Lloyd Perkins of the Salt Lake Valley Deaf Ward learned about the Branch’s battle with Dr. Bitter for attempting to take control of the Branch and Seminar. President Perkins reported that those oral deaf members, who were former students of Dr. Bitter’s seminary class, attended his ward and told him that Dr. Bitter preached to them not to attend the deaf branch or ward as sign language was terrible. It alerted Bishop Perkins, which led him to assist Branch President Kinner to get the battling situation resolved.</p>
		<p>This issue was brought up for action by visiting Neal Maxwell, chairman of the Church Educational Department with Mr. Bradshaw, an assistant. For a few months, Mr. Bradshaw visited and investigated the Branch to solve the problem. Upon investigation, he reported to the Church Department where they made a final decision to purchase a plot on the USD campus and erected a Seminary building on the south end of 20th Street in 1974.</p>
		<p>Under the reorganization of the deaf seminary program, Dr. Bitter was given a choice to either give up his coordinating position at the University of Utah or his coordinating position of the Deaf Seminary; he chose to resign his position as a seminar coordinator. Since the new Seminary building was established, Boyd Nielson was removed as a principal of the seminary classes and oral teachers from Utah School for the Deaf were no longer teaching the seminary classes. A wall of separation between USD and the Branch was created.</p>
		<p>A dream became a reality when the Ogden Seminary for the Deaf had its own building adjacent to the Utah School for the Deaf campus. An open house was held in early October to welcome all visitors to the new facility. On hand were Ed Fisher, a principal who was a fluent signer, and Kyle Jaussi, a teacher. Later, Ed Fisher moved to Alaska. Brother Richard Snow became the first deaf principal and teacher of the seminary class for 36 years. After USD moved to 7th street in 1993, there was no space on campus for him to teach as the majority of deaf students were mainstreamed. He taught the Institute of Religion classes at Salt Lake Community College and eventually taught a Seminary class at Jean Massieu School for the Deaf in Salt Lake City. Upon his retirement in 2008, Patricia Walker’s deaf son, Nathan Van De Graaff became a Coordinator of Seminaries/Institutes for the deaf. [PHOTO]</p>
		<p>Shortly after Ed Fisher was hired, the Branch had finally triumphed over trials and tribulations. However, they experienced a decline in membership among the oral deaf students. Stake President Jensen received a pile of letters from parents and called a meeting with Branch President Kinner. He told him that parents insisted that their oral deaf children attend a hearing ward around the corner. Apparently, the parents were displeased with the Branch Presidency’s intervention with the oral seminary classes. Branch President Kinner and sign language interpreter, Lucy Greenwood were disheartened.</p>
		<p>Per request from parents, Stake President Jensen allowed the oral deaf children to attend the 31st ward with Bishop Tanner. The Ogden Branch for the Deaf faced a new kind of challenge with a lack of leadership among the members and poor activities due to a small number of members.</p>
		<p>In 1975, the Stake Presidency was under reorganization. One day, Apostle Mark E. Petersen met with Branch President Kinner and asked for recommendations on who would be good for a Stake President position. Apostle Petersen then asked him a question about why the Branch was unable to perform the mutual activities. Branch President Kinner explained what happened as stated earlier.</p>
		<p>On the next morning in the Stake Conference, Apostle Mark E. Petersen reported the Stake Presidency business and at his closing talk, he called the audience, “Attention, Attention.” Please help the Ogden Branch for the Deaf build a Kingdom of God on Earth.”</p>
		<p>The following new Stake President, Glenn F. Holley released Branch President Kinner and called Roy Cochran as the new Branch President. They continued to work together to solve the Branch’s internal difficulties. Stake President Holley talked with USD staff members and asked why they separated oral and signing children from spiritual activities. They told him about the school policy. Stake President Holley then said, “We are the children of God” and asked them to leave the Branch alone.</p>
		<p>After that, former Branch President Kinner noticed things were starting to improve a little. The Branch continued to preserve sign language and utilized it when teaching. Those oral deaf students who graduated from USD joined the Branch and learned to sign. The membership grew steadily, but not good enough. The nature of the Branch changed. It was mostly attended and served by family members. Although it created a great burden to operate the Branch with a small number of members, they were extremely attached to it due to the memories of President Woodbury and his efforts to establish a church sorely for deaf members (Giles, 2007, Media Player; Kenneth L. Kinner, personal communication, June 19, 2011).</p>
		<p>As mentioned in Chapter 1, Part III, this is an example of how. Dr. Bitter as a Coordinator of the LDS Deaf Seminary for the State of Utah also had an impact on the Deaf LDS Church.</p>

			<h1>Did You Know?</h1>
			<p>Mabel Bell, a columnist for the UAD Bulletin was known as Ron Nelson. He, as a former oral deaf individual being raised in a Latter-day Saint family, expressed his opinion based on what he observed. He stated:</p>
			<p>Due to Utah’s strong Latter-day Saint (LDS or Mormon) population, a difficult situation existed here for the LDS families who had a deaf child. The Mormons strongly believe their families should be “together.” However when they have a deaf child, they sometimes didn’t know how to achieve and maintain “family togetherness,” when it became obvious the deaf child cannot join in the family’s daily activities. A poor solution that was sometimes selected by desperate parents was to enroll their child in an oral program at school in an attempt to make their child “normal” and thus achieve “family togetherness.” A better solution would be for the parents and the siblings to learning American Sign Language (ASL) and use that as the primary mode of communication when the deaf child was present. I think those parents who learn ASL will achieve a greater degree of family togetherness than those who select the oral method (UAD Bulletin, October 1988, p.4)</p>

			<h1>Did You Know?</h1>
			<p>In Dr. Grant B. Bitter’s Summary Report for Tenure for the University of Utah in 1985, he shared his community services for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. From 1961-1971, he designed, implemented, and directed religious educational for exceptional children/youth in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
			<p>As early as 1961, Dr. Bitter was involved with piloting non-released religious instruction for deaf children/youth. During the first four years, he spent fifty percent time with his academic life at the University of Utah (A teacher training-oral program was established in 1962) and the other fifty percent with the Department of Institutes and Seminaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Upon the completion of his doctorate, he was appointed to pilot/direct religious instruction, not only for the deaf, but for youth with mental retardation, youth who were blind and others in community-based criteria.</p>
			<p>Dr. Bitter reported his exciting experience to inform and instruct on the “evils” of myths. From 1968-1970, he instituted “Annual Seminary Conferences for Exceptional Children and Youth.” Additionally, he was invited to the conferences as a guest speaker such as prominent civic and church notables as: President Joseph Fielding smith, President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and his wife, Jessie Evans Smith; Alvin R. Dyer, and N. Eldon Tanner and Marion G. Romney of the First Presidency. Elders Marvin Ashton and Boyd K. Packer of the Council of Twelve and others</p>
			<p>Dr. Bitter reported that the Deaf community was active in slandering him in the church programs too as they were at the University of Utah. He stated they were actively pressuring the church to adopt total communication as the method of teaching religious concepts to all deaf children as they had done in the educational systems of the nation. Over the years, Dr. Bitter had been very involved with church curriculum committees and the missionary programs of the church to prevent and/or minimize problem areas. He said that Elder James E. Faust of the Quorum of Twelve represented his efforts to inform and to keep freedoms ever in mind. Dr. Bitter further stated that his work was on the “front line of human activity” (Bitter, March 15, 1985).</p>

			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>In May of 1970, Cherie Carpenter Hodson and her LDS Seminary class from Arizona State School for the Deaf and the Blind in Tucson traveled to Salt Lake City, Utah for the Third Annual Seminary Conference for Exceptional Youth.</p>
			<p>At the conference, Dr. Grant B. Bitter, a Supervisor of Religious Education for Exceptional Children and Youth, asked Cherie, who was 15 years old at the time, to speak on Economic Competence with her voice. As she approached the pulpit, she debated whether to use her voice or sign. As she looked at the middle audience, she saw several oral interpreters seating every two rows for oralists and one signing interpreter on the right side of the audience for a whole group of signing students. Cherie impulsively decided to sign and called the signing interpreter to come up to voice while she signed. Dr. Bitter was not happy about it (Cherie Carpenter Hodson, personal communication, October 18, 2010).</p>
