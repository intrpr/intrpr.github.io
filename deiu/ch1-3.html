		<h2><span><a href="#">&#x25B2; back to top</a></span>Chapter 1: The Evolution of Deaf Education in Utah</h2>
<h1>Part III &#8212; An Evolution of the ASL/English Bilingual Teaching Method in Utah</h1>
<p>While the Total Communication programs in the nation were gaining in popularity during the 1970s, some linguists and educators in the United States, Sweden, France, and Denmark began to do research on how bilingual education could be applied to the education of deaf children. From studies done, they urged that the natural sign language of Deaf communities be used in schools for deaf children. Furthermore, they argued that more Deaf teachers should be hired. They would not only teach and be language models but would also be positive adult role models for deaf students under their tutelage.</p>
		<p>In 1981 a milestone was achieved when Sweden passed a bill granting deaf people the right to a bilingual education, achieved with Swedish Sign Language as the primary language of instruction in the schools for deaf children (Erting et al., 1989). Sweden became the first country to recognize Swedish Sign Language as the first language of Deaf people. It was ten years later, in 1991, when the Danish government followed suit in mandating Danish Sign Language as the language of instruction for their deaf students (Timmermans, 2003).</p>
		<p>In America, the bilingual-bicultural movement was launched in 1989 at The Learning Center for the Deaf, a private school located in Framingham, Massachusetts. This ushered in a wind of change that would spread. The Indiana School for the Deaf became the first state school for the deaf that implemented the bilingual program in 1990. Other state schools for the deaf began to follow this trend. This Bi-Bi movement, as it is called, came after three decades of research and documentation on the necessity of using American Sign Language in the classroom for Deaf children.</p>
		<p>The 1990’s ushered in a wind of change when the “bilingual-bicultural” movement started at The Learning Center for the Deaf Children. The Indiana School for the Deaf and other schools serving Deaf and hard-of-hearing students began to follow this trend (Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz, personal communication, March 29, 2010).</p>
		<p>While all these exciting changes were occurring in deaf education, Utah and the Utah School for the Deaf refused to offer the bilingual route. Their programs were categorized as the Oral-Aural program and the Total Communication program. These two programs did not address the concern that the local Deaf community had about literacy among deaf students. It seemed to the Deaf Community that the language and communication needs of the students were not being met. There was research done on American Sign Language, which indicated its success in academics. Deaf professionals, Deaf community members, and some parents were asking “Why couldn’t it be used?” (Bronwyn O’Hara, personal communication, December 1, 2007).</p>
		<p>When parents enrolled their deaf child(ren) at USD, they had to choose between the two options. There were some who were not satisfied with these choices (Butters, Deseret News, July 17, 1995. p. A1). One of those families was the O’Hara’s. In 1992 and 1995, the O’Hara family asked USD to implement a bilingual-bicultural program for their child (Butters, Deseret News, July, 17, 1995, p. A1). During the years 1987-1995 Bronwyn O’Hara, the hearing mother, had read research studies and talked with local Deaf community leaders. Through their help she came to understand that both the Oral-Aural and the Total communication approaches had major linguistic flaws. She didn’t want her deaf children to go through school without language. She shared the literature she gathered on the Bi-Bi approach, the importance of ASL, adult deaf language models, adult deaf role models and deaf peers with the USD administrators. She founded the Support Group for Deaf Education as a way to share this same information with other parents. She was labeled by Steven W. Noyce, her child’s program director, as an extremist and a zealot. He actively steered other parents away from her.</p>
		<p>Steven W. Noyce was the Deaf Program Director for every deaf child in the State of Utah outside of Salt Lake City and Ogden (Butters, Deseret News, July 17, 1995, p. A1). He said the goal of USD’s programs “was to teach [deaf students] English, not ASL.” He also said, “Schools need to teach English because that is what is going to determine if a deaf person is successful.” Over the 8 years the O’Haras lived in Utah, Bronwyn sent copies of research studies to Noyce that filled 3 very thick file folders. Regardless of research studies showing better fluency in English through ASL, Noyce would not budge in permitting ASL in the classrooms as the language of instruction. O’Hara expressed her disappointment by saying “I am unhappy with the school system and have tried to figure out the right framework to solve this problem.” In her view, “the administration has a personal bias against the idea of a visual language. The school is definitely not a ‘barrier-free environment” (Romboy, Deseret News, April 13, 1995, p. A1).</p>
		<p>During this time, then USD Superintendent David West admitted the new approach would fill a void in the school’s program; however, he was not ready to implement it (Butters, Deseret News, July 17, 1995, p. A1). Two of the non-negotiable problems at this time were that 1) few teachers knew ASL and 2) both teachers and administrators were not trained in how to use the bilingual-bicultural approach to educate deaf children (Butters, Deseret News, July 17, 1995, p. A1). A local deaf professional, Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz, shared her knowledge with USD via reports presented in person to the Institutional Council, the governing body of USD. She explained that deaf children who learn ASL as their first language have enhanced language skills and learn English better. She stated, “A deaf child does need exposure to English early in life, but his/her visual needs overwhelm what English can offer” (Butters, Deseret News, July 17, 1995, p. A1). Regardless of this influx of information, USD remained unwilling and unable to change.</p>
		<p>Like what a lot of previous families had done, the O’Hara’s moved out-of-state in 1995 to send their deaf child to a school that espoused the bilingual-bicultural approach. Below is a summary that Bronwyn O’Hara has written of her battle with the deaf educational system at USD during the 8 years they lived in Utah (1987-1995).</p>
<p>While the O’Hara family was battling with USD, throughout the country a handful of schools for the deaf was starting to use the ASL/English bilingual education approach (Romboy, Deseret News, April 13, 1992, p. B1). Like what a lot of families had done in the past, the O’Hara family moved out of state to find a school that espoused the bilingual-bicultural approach.</p>
		<h3> One Family’s Story: The O’Haras</h3>
		<p>It was 1987 when the O’Hara family moved from Idaho to Utah. They had one deaf pre-teen daughter, one hard-of-hearing son, two hearing children, and a deaf toddler. Educational access to American Sign Language for the two deaf children was not available through the public school. Turning to the school for the deaf as the logical place to get appropriate services, it was quite a shock to find inadequate services. Bronwyn requested a signing Parent-Infant Program (PIP) advisor and was told there were none. Skip Reese, the PIP director at the time, told Bronwyn that the program was a lot better than 20 years prior. Bronwyn even called Thomas Clark, who founded the SKI-HI program that PIP used. He counseled her to watch the movie Persuasion and apply the principles therein to her situation. Neither of these made the O’Hara’s feel very good. What difference did it make that the current program bad as it was, was better than the supposedly horrible program of twenty years prior when their deaf children needed these better services now. The children couldn’t stop growing up and wait for educational improvements.</p>
		<p>The family went in search of the local deaf community. They became well acquainted with many of the active deaf leaders in both Provo and Salt Lake City. Thus began 8 years of tutoring and mentoring in deaf culture and language by the deaf community. The most influential person that the family met was Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz. The second was Julie Eldredge. Without them, the family would never have understood their deaf children’s needs or how language is acquired.</p>
		<p>As Bronwyn interfaced with the Utah Schools for the Deaf and Blind (USDB), she shared the educational articles and studies that she received from these deaf leaders. She thought the school would welcome this information so as to improve their school and increase the options they offered to parents. She attended innumerable USDB Institutional Council meetings, copied and mailed on-going information to her program coordinator, and used her children’s IEP meetings as a forum to educate the educators and ask for services. For a brief period she convinced the Total Communication classroom in Orem to allow an ASL storytime once a week. She wrote and got a grant from an Art organization to pay the storytellers, Nannette Hix and Julie Eldredge. However, it was discontinued after a few months. The school didn’t want to pay the storyteller as an educational specialist nor did it want to apply for the grant so it could continue. After 5 years of all this activity and with nothing really changing, Bronwyn decided it was time to network with other parents. One person could easily be ignored but not a whole group of parents asking for the same educational change.</p>
		<p>She created the Support Group for Deaf Education with the intent to help other parents become as informed about the educational needs of their deaf child(ren) as she was. For the first year and a half there were parent meetings, guest speakers, and a monthly newsletter. After that there was just the monthly newsletter. She wrote an article for publication in the Utah Parent Center newsletter explaining her group’s purpose, seeking to reach more parents of deaf children. The Utah Association of the Deaf (UAD) validated her work by sending her to an educational conference in Nebraska. During the educational overhaul Utah went through in the late 1980’s she was one who approached the Utah COED committee during their public forums. She brought information about a deaf child’s need for language, deaf peers, deaf adult role-models, and direct access to teachers without the use of interpreters.</p>
		<p>Superintendent West was sympathetic to her requests. However, he was unable to make changes and didn’t stay long in Utah. As the years went by, all of these ideas and persuasions seemed to fall on ‘deaf’ hearing ears, creating a feeling of urgency for the O’Hara’s. Their older daughter was high school age and the younger one was beginning early elementary school. It was a time of decision for the family.</p>
		<p>Bronwyn, convinced that her deaf child had a right to language, consulted the Legal Center for the Handicapped in Salt Lake City. She thought they could help her pull together a lawsuit to force USDB to provide her child a language of instruction that was compatible with her deafness. She reasoned that if hearing peers have access to their language of English in the classroom, why couldn’t her child have access to her language? Her deaf child’s language was American Sign Language, which was not being supplied by the school. The school was supplying a non-language signing modality for instruction. This modality could not provide educational access and should be deemed as inappropriate. It would be through American Sign Language that her child would be able to receive a free and appropriate education. The lawyer at the Center was sympathetic but he explained they did not and could not get involved with a language issue. Their work was focused on workplace discrimination not with educational discrimination in the school setting. To Bronwyn’s knowledge, there was no other legal resource that would take the school to court over this issue of educational language needs of deaf children.
			Bronwyn was feeling desperate with the years of her children’s education slipping away. She found that the educational principle that governed meeting deaf children’s classroom needs was 1) the child had to fail before something was mandated to change and 2) the course material offered at USDB was remedial based only. With two very bright deaf children to educate, it was not a question of failing. With nothing else to create a need for change, Bronwyn decided the girls had to attend a school out of Utah. The California School for the Deaf at Fremont, California had the highest academic rating among the deaf community and was suggested to the O’Hara’s for their daughters. This was arranged.</p>
		<p>Molly was back in a month. Not wanting to have frustrating dealings with USDB again, the family approached the Special Education director in their local Nebo school district. They refused to provide a sign language interpreter for Molly. When Bronwyn said she would send Molly to school without her hearing aid, creating a need for an interpreter, he said he could take the family to court for withholding from Molly what she needed for academic success. Bronwyn was threatening to do something to get a service from the district. He didn't want to provide an interpreter so he was threatening her back so she would not feel so sure of her legal foundation. He implied that he could get them on 'charges' of willfully withholding something for Molly's educational needs that they could give her or had already been using for her.</p>
		<p>Finding that the local community college, Utah Valley Community College, provided interpreters without a fuss, Molly decided to take the GED on her 17th birthday, the soonest allowed by law, and moved into the college realm of education.
			Ellen remained at the California School for the Deaf for her 2nd and 3rd grade years. Looking back, Ellen says that was a time when her ‘eyes were opened’ to realizing that she was smart and there was knowledge for her to gain. That was a turning point for her in her view of herself and education. But two years was all the family could manage and Ellen was brought back to USDB for 4th grade. One and a half frustrating years later, it was at this juncture that the O’Hara family decided to look for a school that had a Bilingual-Bicultural philosophy already in place. This philosophy combined the educational instruction in ASL with the learning of written English, as well as options for spoken English. The school that seemed to meet their needs was the Indiana School for the Deaf in Indianapolis, Indiana. They moved in early 1995 while Ellen was in 5th grade. They wanted their youngest daughter to receive the education, language models, and peer interactions she deserved.</p>
		<p>Though there was no support from the school administration for the language of sign to be used as the instructional medium, Bronwyn did get USDB to put in a toll-free phone number so parents could call school personnel free-of-charge. Over the intervening years 1995-2009, there have been good strides of improvement made with the addition of the Deaf Mentor program and the Jean Massieu School, to name two.</p>

		<h1>Did you know?</h1>
		<p>When Bronwyn O’Hara was called an extremist and a zealot by Steven W. Noyce, she was not alone in this situation. One parent commented in the UAD Bulletin issue as follows, “There has been a concerted effort on many of the USDB administrative staff to keep parents from networking, keep parents fighting with each other, and keep parents ignorant of the truths about current findings about Deaf Education” (UAD Bulletin, February 1996, p. 12).</p>

		<p>In January 1992, USDB Superintendent David West with its five school program coordinators traveled to California Schools for the Deaf at Fremont and Riverside, and a program at Belmont, California and also to the Idaho School for the Deaf in Gooding, Idaho to observe their bilingual programs (UAD Bulletin, February 1992).</p>

		<h3> A Regional Bilingual/Bicultural Conference</h3>
		<p>Shirley Hortie Platt, a deaf advocate, was getting angrier and angrier at Utah School for the Deaf and she didn’t even have deaf children. She was a Deaf Mentor under Dr. Petra Horn-Marsh. She was frustrated at the number of deaf children deprived of their natural language along with the Parent Infant Program's lack of improvement and total insensitivity to the input from the many Deaf Mentors. To top off her frustration, she saw the paternalistic and patronizing attitudes from the USDB teachers and administrators and was horrified by this and their ignorance. She decided that if one wanted to effect change, one had to do it oneself, and so she did (Shirley Hortie Platt, personal communication, November 7, 2008). Spurred on by the continued failure and limited achievement of deaf students at USD and mainstreamed school placements Shirley hosted a two-day regional Bilingual/Bicultural conference on April 25-26, 1997 at the Eccles Conference Center in Ogden. This conference was for Utah parents of deaf children, deaf adults, teachers and administrators. Approximately 400 persons attended, many from out-of-state. Distinguished presenters were Dr. Lawrence Fleischer, Department Chair, Deaf Studies, California State University-Northridge who discussed Deaf identity; Dr. Martina J. "MJ" Bienvenu of Maryland who discussed Deaf culture; Dr. Marlon Kuntze, University of California, Berkeley who discussed language; and Dr. Joseph Innes, Gallaudet University who discussed Deaf education. A group from Indiana School for the Deaf also presented on the establishment of a bilingual-bicultural program there.</p>
		<p>Participants also watched a movie directed by Dr. Fleischer, “I Love You, But...” and enjoyed a small performance depicting “An Evening of Signed History of Utah Deaf Community” emceed by Dr. Petra Horn (UAD Bulletin, June 1997; Shirley Hortie Platt, personal communication, November 7, 2008).</p>
		<p>The conference was highly successful in opening the paradigms of hearing people towards the talents and intrinsic value of deaf people, and was much talked about for a long time (UAD Bulletin, June 1997).</p>
		<h3>The Creation of a Bilingual/Bicultural Committee</h3>
		<p>In June 1997 at UAD’s biennial conference, under the leadership of UAD president Dennis Platt, Shirley’s husband, the Bilingual/Bicultural Committee was established. Its assignment was to explore the possibility of implementing a bilingual approach at USD and discuss alternative options for educating deaf students. Robert Guillory made a motion at the UAD conference after the BiBi conference to form a BiBi committee with Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz, a Deaf parent of three deaf children. He pushed push the idea of the committee, and there was a group of them who discussed it and decided that she should be chair. It was the first time a motion came with a specific person as chair. Dennis Platt said that normally a committee is organized, then the UAD Board chooses who the chair is to be, but this time Robert Guillory’s motion included the wording that Minnie Mae was to be chair. None of them had an idea it would turn into a day school - the main idea was to have the committee look into the possibility of adding a BiBi option to Utah's Deaf education (Minnie Mae Wilding Diaz, personal communication, June 30, 2011).</p>
		<p>At this time and throughout its campaign, UAD’s committee used the term “Bi-Bi”. This was intentional as they wanted to emphasize not only the dual languages required for the ultimate education of deaf children but also for the need of incorporating the culture of deaf people in their education (Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz, personal communication, March 29, 2010).</p>
		<p>Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz was elected to be chair of the Bi-Bi Committee. The first meeting was held in October 1997 with approximately twenty-five people attending. Over the next couple of meetings, the numbers dwindled and the demographics of the people involved changed from mostly Deaf to a mixture of Deaf and hearing (Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz, personal communication, March 29, 2010).</p>
		<p>After the Bi-Bi Committee of the UAD, chaired by Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz had been working several months in search of a worthy educational program for deaf children in Utah, two leaders emerged: Minnie Mae and Jeff Allen, a hearing parent with a deaf daughter. On March 30, 1998, the Bi-Bi Committee’s first step was to talk with Dr. Lee Robinson, USD Superintendent and Joseph DiLorenze, Assistant Superintendent to see if USD could add a Bi-Bi educational option. However, despite the federal Bilingual Education Act of 1988 that included deaf students for the first time under the protection of the legal definition regarding native language and limited English proficiency, and the Utah Senate Bill 42 passed in 1994 which recognized ASL as a language, USD administrators were not interested in or ready for including or developing a Bi-Bi educational option (Utah State Legislature, 1994; Zapien, 1998). The committee was basically told, "No thanks and good luck” (Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz, personal communication, March 29, 2010). He gave lukewarm support to what the committee had been doing. While the meeting did not work out, the Bi-Bi Committee received enormous support from the Deaf community, parents of deaf children, and friends of the deaf (UAD Bulletin, May 1988).</p>
		<p>UAD funded the Bi-Bi Committee to cover the interpreting costs and some office supplies. 95-98% funding went to the interpreting costs. The more funding came long after the meeting with Dr. Lee Robinson (Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz, personal communication, June 30, 2011).</p>
		<h3>Founding the Jean Massieu School of the Deaf</h3>
	<p>The most exciting rippling event since October 1997 was the Bi-Bi Committee, which had been meeting regularly every two weeks. Their main goal was to establish a program or school that would use the “Bi’Bi” approach to teaching deaf children. More and more [hearing] parents were showing up and becoming involved in the effort. The American Dream was getting closer to reality, but there was a long ways to go. The parents wanted the best quality of education possible for their deaf children and so did the Deaf community. The Bi-Bi Committee definitely wanted the best quality education possible for their deaf children because they were their future leaders (Mortensen, UAD Bulletin, June 1998; Wilding-Diaz, UAD Bulletin, June 1999).</p>
		<p>Because Utah School for the Deaf was not ready to incorporate ASL into their curriculum, the Bi-Bi Committee explored several avenues to see where it would be best to start. Simultaneously, the Utah State Legislature worked on a charter school bill. The Bi-Bi Committee decided to focus their energies on getting the Utah Charter Schools Act passed. This supporting legislation would allow charter schools to be formed within the state. The Act was passed at the end of the 1998 Legislative session (Utah Charter Schools Act, 1998; Wilding-Diaz, UAD Bulletin, June 1999).</p>
		<p>After the Utah Charter Schools Act was enacted, the Bi-Bi Committee contacted Governor Mike Leavitt’s Office and the State Board of Education for an application to set up a charter school for the deaf (UAD Bulletin, May 1998). The timing of this action could not have been more propitious and in June 1998, the Bi-Bi Committee immediately proceeded to develop a proposal for approval by the Utah State Board of Education. On July 29, 1998, a huge step was realized for deaf children when the Utah State Board of Education approved of the proposal that the Bi-Bi Committee had submitted to the Board requesting charter school status.</p>
		<p>The Bi-Bi Committee and Tuacahan High School, performing arts were first two schools selected, a big honor for them. The Board of Education chose up to six more schools in November of that year (UAD Bulletin, September 1998). The Bi-Bi Committee proceeded with planning and establishing a school of their own, to begin in the Fall of 1999 (UAD Bulletin, September 1998). In an unprecedented move, the Bi-Bi committee had the Deaf community vote on the name for the school, from among three choices: Alice Cogswell School, George Veditz School, and Jean Massieu. The new charter school for the deaf was named Jean Massieu School of the Deaf (JMS) in honor of Jean Massieu, a French Deaf teacher who was the first Deaf teacher in the world. Princes, philosophers, and even the pope traveled to see and question him. He was the teacher and mentor of Laurent Clerc, a deaf man who came to America with Thomas H. Gallaudet, to help establish the first deaf school here in our country. He was bilingual. He could read and write French. Many of his pupils went on to direct schools for deaf children in other countries (UAD Bulletin, June 1998; Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz, personal communication, March 29, 2010).</p>
		<p>The charter schools formed under the Utah Charter Schools Act were required to be not-for-profit organizations. The committee solved this problem by evolving itself into a non-profit organization known as Utah Deaf Education and Literacy, Inc in 1998. The main goal of UDEAL was to establish, operate, and govern the new charter school whose main thrust would be found in its mission statement, summarized here as “an educational entity that incorporates ASL as the language of communication and instruction.” Another main goal was to raise funds for the school (UAD Bulletin, September 1998; Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz, personal communication, March 29, 2010).</p>
		<h3>Utah Deaf Education and Literacy, Inc Board Founds</h3>
		<p>On August 19, 1998, the Bi-Bi Committee met and selected seven people to serve on the Utah Deaf Education and Literacy, Inc Board in addition to Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz and Jeff Allen, co-administrators for the school. The seven people, in alphabetical order, were (UAD Bulletin, September 1998):</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Marla Broetz (Deaf)</li>
			<li>Pattie Dawson</li>
			<li>Stephen Ehrlich (Deaf-Blind)</li>
			<li>Brad Houck</li>
			<li>Billy & Heather Kendrick</li>
			<li>Sarah Peterson</li>
			<li>Jim & Tracie Wintch</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>JMS’s Mission and Vision Statements</h3>
		<p>UDEAL acknowledged the research that consistently showed Deaf children of Deaf parents have greater English and academic achievements compared to deaf children of hearing parents. With that backing, UDEAL created JMS’s mission and vision statements to finally put the focus where it belonged: on a “Deaf-Centered” education. Their goal was to provide classrooms designed to capitalize upon the strengths and visual needs of deaf and hard of hearing students. As part of the ASL/English bilingual philosophy, ASL was used as the primary language of instruction and communication. English was taught as a second language through its visual forms: reading and writing. ASL and written English were both recognized and provided with equal access (Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz, personal communication, March 29, 2010).</p>
		<h4>Mission Statement</h4>
		<p>“Jean Massieu School (JMS) is an educational entity that involves families, school personnel, students, and the Deaf and hearing communities in providing academic and social excellence to its students through an ASL/English bilingual environment.
			In our model of a Bi-Bi education, teachers use American Sign Language (ASL) as the primary language of communication. With a well-based foundation in ASL, our students learn English, mainly through reading and writing, and acquire literacy skills in both languages. Cultural aspects of the two languages are learned as the students receive educational, social, and emotional support from both communities.”</p>
		<h4>Vision Statement</h4>
		<p>“The ultimate purpose and goal of JMS is to empower its students with both linguistic and cultural expertise so they can compete in the world they will face upon leaving this school. It is the goal of JMS to prepare its students academically, linguistically, socially, emotionally, and technologically for any educational or vocational situation they enter after leaving JMS. A big part of the program at JMS is returning to a “Deaf-Centered” education. By “Deaf Centered,” we mean that the communication and instruction that occur in the classroom build on the Deaf and hard of hearing children’s strengths. The language, visual orientation, and instinctive cultural needs of deaf and hard of hearing children are acknowledged. At JMS, the Deaf and hard of hearing children thus feel as normal and intelligent as anyone else.</p>
		<p>Deaf culture has developed over time to become a highly successful and functional community with its own unique cultural characteristics, including values, beliefs, history, and rules of behavior. Faculty and staff at JMS use these highly successful ingredients of the adult Deaf population with the likewise visually-oriented Deaf and hard of hearing students. In this view, the Deaf and hard of hearing children are perceived as Deaf children who will grow up to be successful Deaf adults.”</p>
<h3>“It Takes a Village to Raise a Child”</h3>
		<p>In May 1998, Kristi Mortensen quoted First Lady of the United States Hillary Rodham Clinton’s famous the ancient African Proverb, “It takes a village to raise a child” in the UAD Bulletin, in attempt to end the controversial educational issues by improving the quality of education in the modern world and to advocate the concept of a village among hearing parents of deaf children and Deaf community. As a long-time deaf education advocate, Kristi said the Deaf community and hearing families of deaf children was the village. She felt the deaf children in Utah were Deaf community’s future leaders. Hence, it was their responsibility to meet hearing parents of deaf children and be friends with then. She asked the Deaf community to aside their differences and start working with hearing parents who really have the desire to give deaf children an education equal to hearing children. Many parents agreed that they need the Deaf community in raising their deaf children to become the best of the best (Kristi, UAD Bulletin, May 1998).</p>
		<p>In the school settings, Kristi strongly felt the deaf students needed deaf role models visiting their classrooms as part of their teaching curriculum. She encouraged the Deaf community to volunteer to visit the classrooms as often as possible as it would be a priceless educational experience for students (Mortensen, UAD Bulletin, June 1998).</p>
		<p>Kristi in her pre-teens remembered watching the Deaf community fighting hard to establish a Total Communication Program in the 1970’s. She observed that Utah was the only state, which continued carrying a two-track system – Oral and Total Communication. She asked the Deaf community to aside their differences and start working with parents who really have the desire to give deaf children an education equal to hearing children. Many of them agreed that they need the Deaf community in raising their deaf children to become the best of the best. Kristi said the times were changing with the new technology skills, all communication methods, especially American Sign Language, and Deaf culture must be a part of an education program for deaf children (Mortensen, UAD Bulletin, May 1998). Kristi recognized that ASL and Deaf culture play a more important role in every young deaf child’s life. Many linguisticians had spent years researching the role of ASL. More and more professionals had concluded that if the Deaf community is part of the classroom, the deaf students do much, much better. Their chances for success in life grow tremendously. Kristi then asked, “Why don’t we stand up and sign strongly, “Let us be a part of your school curriculum” (Mortensen, UAD Bulletin, June 1998).</p>
		<p>In addition, Krisit asked the Deaf community to take up the cause and be willing to get together and fight the battle for the right to a quality education. When a deaf child receives a quality of education, it will help the child become independent and succeed in a fast-moving world of tomorrow, she said (Mortensen, UAD Bulletin, May 1998).</p>
		<p>Lastly, Kristi felt it was important to have high expectations of deaf children to become great leaders. In American dreams, she said the Deaf community, parents, and teachers can achieve that if they have the same goal and desires to build barrier-free environment for deaf children in school, outside of the school, and everywhere. She even stated, “If we all stand in unity – working together to building barrier-free environments in the school system and quality educational systems, deaf role models will visit the schools where deaf students meet. The more deaf children associate with role models, the more they will become contributing members of society and influence the next generation of deaf children. The benefits will be passed on from generation to generation” (Mortensen, UAD Bulletin, August 1998).</p>
		<h3>Jean Massieu School Opens Its Doors</h3>
		<p>Starting a new school required a lot of work. The Bi-Bi Committee had to find a location, find more money, choose the books they wanted their students to learn from, hire teachers and assistants, buy supplies, and etc (UAD Bulletin, September 1998). Eventually, the UDEAL Board assumed a little more responsibility with fundraising, programs, Individualized Education Plan meetings, transportation, building/site, and technology.</p>
		<p>After months of preparation, Jean Massieu School opened its doors to 21 students from preschool through the third grade on August 29, 1999. Expanding a grade each year, JMS has continued to grow to encompass grades from Pre-K through 9th grade. It provides full language and communication access in ASL and English on campus. The approach at JMS has brought ‘full circle’ the bilingual approach that was used at schools for deaf children in the 19th century (Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz, personal communication, March 29, 2010).</p>
		<h3>Golden Hand Award</h3>
		<p>The Bi-Bi Committee and UAD worked closely with each other until Utah Deaf Education and Literacy, Inc. was formed, after which UDEAL had to strike out on their own because UAD and UDEAL were two separate non-profit organizations. UDEAL representatives continued to come to UAD meetings to keep UAD informed about JMS. That way, the Deaf community was kept connected (Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz, personal communication, March 29, 2010).</p>
		<p>Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz was the chair of the UDEAL, and Jeff Allen diligently guided the board and governed the board meetings. Minnie Mae and Jeff worked together as co administrators of the school, overseeing everyday business of the school. Minnie Mae was the interior person working with the lead teacher, curriculum, and the personnel while Jeff was the exterior person working with the State Office of Education charter school committee as well as with other educators and legislators. They did all that on their own personal time without pay (UAD Bulletin, November 1999).</p>
		<p>After the hard work of forming JMS, UAD awarded Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz and Jeff Allen its prestigious Golden Hand award. The Golden Hand Award, the organization’s highest honor, is presented biennially to an individual(s) or organization(s) that have substantially contributed to the betterment of Utah’s Deaf community.</p>
	<h3>Efforts to Support the Jean Massieu School</h3>
		<p>Since Jean Massieu School of the Deaf was established in August 1999, the Deaf community showed their efforts in supporting the school by donating money for supplies that the school needed, such as crayons, pencils, scissors, and eraser. JMS cannot survive without the Deaf community, and many of them were generous for helping out with various donations (UDEAL, UAD Bulletin, August 1999). Greg Born, son of Jeff and Vicky Born and grandson of Peggy Harper, who as part of his Eagle Scout project, worked hard collecting a whole trailer full of supplies and equipment for the school (UAD Bulletin, September 1999).</p>
		<p>The Deaf community even helped with moving and visited the classrooms to serve as a deaf role model. JMS continued to receive donations of all kinds such as books, school supplies, and more importantly, money, to build up the inventory at the school. JMS had several volunteers doing janitorial work, raking leaves, helping students with individual works and others (Wilding, UAD Bulletin, April 2001).</p>
		<p>JMS was under the UDEAL Board, which was composed of parents. Almost half of the parents were deaf and most of the parents were new to the Deaf Culture and to ASL. Jerry Wilding, principal observed the parents tried to operate the school the best they knew how. Although he enjoyed working with the board and thought the students benefit a great deal under the Bi-Bi concept, he felt there was always a room for improvement. Jerry felt that the board needed a person who is deaf and has some experience going through all the so-called experiments of educating the deaf to join the board to give a perspective to balance of the experts with the new people in JMS. Jerry was hoping to see someone in the state of Utah ad new blood to the board and make JMS far more attractive to deserving deaf kids in the big world of mainstreaming. He had seen tremendous support from the Deaf community in person, but not in the capacity of board support and participation (Wilding, UAD Bulletin, May 2001).</p>
		<h3>Thought of the Month</h3>
		<p>Dr. Robert G. Sanderson shared that, If there is anything I have really learned from my service on the Institutional Council, it is that the education of deaf, hard of hearing and blind, visually impaired children is far more complex than most people would believe. It is not, as I think many deaf people believe, a simple matter of “signs vs. oral” approaches” (Sanderson, UAD Bulletin, May 2001).</p>
		<aside>
			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>On October 22, 2002, JMS had its very first PTA meeting in the school’s history. Having a PTA was essential to strengthening the school and its programs (Horn, UAD Bulletin, November 2002).</p>
		</aside>
		<h3>Mascot</h3>
		<p>The mascot at JMS was chosen by the student body in March 2003. The Yellowjacket was chosen because it represents the determination of our student body to continue against all odds, never giving up. Instead of the bee which has a barbed sting that detaches when used resulting in the death of the bee, the yellow jacket has a smooth sting that it can use to sting its victim over and over again. Also, it was due to the fact that bees and yellowjackets were not supposed to be able to fly because of the heaviness and size of their bodies. Scientists were trying to find out how could they fly while other insects with lighter and right sizes, they could fly. To make Yellowjacket their mascot, it represents that even though Deaf people can’t hear, they can do anything. The students learned about those facts from a teacher, and decided to keep Yellowjacket as their mascot for their school.</p>
		<p>The mascot design incorporates a subtle “J” shape in the yellowjacket as well as displaying its hands formed in the “M” and “S” handshapes of the manual alphabet (Leanna Turnman, personal communication, 2009; Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz, personal communication, March 29, 2010). The school mascot and colors were vital to build the school spirit and to establish athletic teams for the students to compete against the other schools when JMS erects a middle school and a high school (Horn, UAD Bulletin, November 2002).</p>

		<h3>UAD President’s Message </h3>
		<p>Ron Nelson, UAD president stated in the UAD Bulletin that someone said that UAD should support the Jean Massieu School because “our future leaders will come from JMS.” He agreed with that comment. He also believed that their future leaders will come from the Utah School for the Deaf too.</p>
		<p>He commented that due to the decline in residential schools, the number of deaf children in the mainstream programs had increased. Their exposure to the Deaf community was minimal and he believed that this is not beneficial to them nor the Deaf community. Upon their graduation from high schools, many of them finally met the Deaf adults in the Deaf community and began a community education that should head begun when they were very young. During this education, they learned manners and what were appropriate and inappropriate behaviors, gain a self-identity, learn and develop their skills in sports or leadership or politics. Often they got involved in deaf organizations just because they were hungry for the social interaction. Ron acknowledged that this was not the case for deaf students at JMS.</p>
<p>Ron would very much like to see JMS program stay for a very long time. He mentioned that USDB Superintendent Robinson Lee expressed his desire to see the test results of JMS students and said if they were better than USD, he would seriously look at the JMS program and see what features could be introduced into the USD program to make it more effective for deaf students (Nelson, UAD Bulletin, October 2003).</p>
		<p>In the following January 2004, JMS met both state and federal performance standards for student participation and achievement on state tests in language arts and math. JMS also met the academic achievement goals under No Child Left Behind (UAD Bulletin, January 2004).</p>
<h3>UDEAL Struggles To Govern and Operate JMS</h3>
		<p>Jean Massieu School operated independently as a Bi-Bi charter school for six years. The former deaf administrators were David G. “Jerry” Wilding, Dr. Petra M. Horn-Marsh, and Benjamin Lee. During these six years, even though JMS did receive donations, it existed mainly on funds received from the state in accordance to the number of students enrolled at the school. Unfortunately, it was not enough. Most charter schools had at least 20 students per teacher, and so the monies allocated to the school per classroom was adequate for paying the teacher’s salary and benefits and other necessary expenses such as administration staff, books and materials/supplies, etc. In spite of JMS being a poorly equipped school with lack of supplies, materials, and resources, it well placed by teachers and students, which heavily involved in literacy and field trip promotion.</p>
		<p>At JMS, however, most classrooms had 6-8 students. What monies the school was apportioned from the state was barely enough to cover teacher salaries and benefits. The board governing JMS had to volunteer a lot of their time (in addition to their full-time jobs) to cover duties like arranging transportation routes, attending IEP meetings, purchasing and ordering books, supplies and materials, interviewing and hiring faculty and staff, and attending state mandated meetings regarding yearly assessments and administering the actual assessments, etc.</p>
		<p>Another challenge that the board faced was the unwillingness of USDB to share information about a new educational option available in Utah: ASL/English bilingual (then called the bilingual-bicultural option) with parents and students. Parent Infant Program and other USDB staff did not consider JMS a viable option for families seeking information about educational opportunities in Utah. They actually told parents that JMS was for students who had low educational abilities and/or were falling behind (see the letter posted on utahdeafeducation.com by "Anonymous"). (As a side note, this sentiment was still felt by many faculty and staff members at USD, see the letter by Melissa Miller on the same website for an example.)
		<blockquote>
			<p>August 20, 2009<br>Dear Parents,</p>
			<p>We have a daughter that was born with LVA (Large Vestibular Aqueduct); this condition could cause a gradual or sudden loss of hearing. We knew that our daughter may be able to hear with hearing aids now, but there could be the possibility that she could wake up one day with no hearing. We taught her American Sign Language from birth, and continued throughout her toddler years. She was had such a wonderful childhood. She was never frustrated when she could not hear us...she was able to communicate through sign-language.</p>
			<p>As she entered pre-school, we knew that her main language was sign-language. We explored all over looking for a program that could offer her what she needed. There was nothing. The only option was a small school that housed 30+ children in a duplex smaller than our home. We knew that we did not want our daughters’ education in this situation. Our other options were the oral program, and the TC program at USDB. The TC program did not appeal to us, because it was not a solid communication mode. Both languages were being delivered in a manner that was impossible to learn each language fluently.</p>
			<p>We ended up choosing the oral program because there was a teacher that was deaf and that knew sign. We figured if nothing else it was a good time for our daughter to work on her speech. She continued for 3 years in this program. We asked as she entered kindergarten for her to have an interpreter. They told us that it was against the program rules. Her hearing started to decline, and we knew that the only option would be to move her into JMS. JMS had finally moved to a nicer location in a real school. Part of the process in moving her was to re-evaluate her IEP. There was not one person in favor of this move. They expressed the opinion is that the only reason a child should go to JMS is if there are other issues that makes the child unable to hear or if they are low function. My daughter was neither. We merely wanted our child to perfect a fluency in sign-language so that if she did choose to ever be mainstreamed she would be able to fully utilize an interpreter. Steve Noyce was very strongly opposed to this. He requested that a hearing be held. 12 people from the Granite District & USDB were in attendance; all voted that our daughter should not be placed in JMS. We declined to take their recommendation, and Mr. Noyce made us sign away that if her education declined, they were not responsible. He reminded us over and over again that the only children that belonged in JMS were those were falling behind.</p>
			<p>Our daughter stayed for 2 years. She accomplished exactly what we wanted her to accomplish. She is now mainstreamed with an interpreter. She is on the honor roll. She learns at very high levels, and never misses a beat. If we had taken the advice of Steve Noyce, I do not believe that she would be as successful as she is in her academics.</p>
			<p>Mr. Noyce is strongly against bi-bi education. Allowing him to be placed in this position will affect the overall success of deaf children in receiving full access to education. You will be doing a disservice to all deaf children throughout the state.</p>

		<p>This letter was submitted to Dr. Martall Menlove on August 20, 2009, soon after Steven W. Noyce was hired as the USDB Superintendent:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>February 20, 2011<br>Dear Parents,</p>
			<p>My name is Melissa Miller, but more importantly, I am a mommy of a 5 years old little boy named Cache. Cache has severe to profound bilateral hearing loss, and currently uses hearing aids. His hearing loss is due to a rare heart condition called Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome, a form of Long QT syndrome. He is our only deaf child of four, and the only deaf person in our family. As you may be aware, there are many options when choosing an education for your deaf child. I would like to share our story with you and how our, once, very unsure future has turned into such a wonderful experience for us.</p>
			<p>When Cache was first born we were told he may be deaf; as he never passed his new born hearing screen. At the time, this seemed circumstantial compared to what we were going through with his heart problems. As time went on, many heart surgeries later, and many miss-diagnoses, Cache finally had an official hearing loss diagnosis. Cache was placed with hearing aids at the age of 2.5. After the long journey we had just been through, we thought this would be easy part.</p>
			<p>When Cache turned 3 years old, it was time to choose which language direction he was going head in. Cache, coming from an all hearing family, it was a pretty simple choice for us. He was to be in the Total Communication (TC) class. We figured this would be the best placement because we had already started to sign with him, but we were told that eventually he would form speech. As time would have it, speech never came to Cache as easy as we would have liked. We had spent many hours and lots of money on speech therapy, and it seemed as though, language was not simple for him. His American Sign Language (ASL) was even behind. We eventually dreaded going to his Individual Education Plan’s (IEP) because we knew that we were not going to hear what we wanted to hear. There were many things concerning us, but most importantly, why he was not speaking when it was clear he could hear fine with his hearing aids. Many teachers believed Cache had a processing disorder and that was the reason he was not learning language in any form. By the end of his last year in pre-school, age 4, he was communicating as a 2 years old in both in ASL and speech.</p>
			<p>When Cache was ready to enter Kindergarten we had to choose which language path we would take again, as there was no longer a TC program offered. I have to admit, we were a little somber by the choice we knew we had to make. There was no way he could attend an all hearing school. Jean Massieu School of the Deaf (JMS) seemed to be the only choice we had. It was if we were picking the lesser of two evils. We were scared to death for him. We were so unsure of the future and what life would be like for Cache. We wondered how he would ever understand anyone in the school, since he was so dependent on both ASL and speech clues. This door we had to open for him seemed so dark and scary, and yet here we were pushing him through it.</p>
			<p>We came to find very quickly that the dark and scary door we pushed him though, was truly only dark and scary for us. What we did find was a bright, happy, little boy who was with people just like him. People he could connect with and be himself with. As of today, Cache’s ASL is far surpassing ours and his vocabulary has grown tremendously. His speech, as well, has become clearer and is growing. He is soaring through school and is further along then his older brothers were at his age. He has learned more in the short 5+ months he has attended JMS then he did the first few years of his education. I can tell you Cache is the happiest little boy and loves going to school every day. He is surrounded by wonderful teachers and amazing kids. He is accepted and loved for just what he is, deaf. He has peers that he can communicate with, which when communicating with hearing kids is sometimes the hardest thing for him. JMS is by far, one of the greatest schools we have ever encountered. I wish sometimes, I knew then what I know now. I wish someone would have told me that my deaf son belongs in a deaf school, with deaf children. That this school would be the best placement and education for him.</p>
			<p>I would like to wish anyone luck who is on their path to find the best placement for their deaf child. As I know, it is not always one shoe fits all and a personal choice, but I know my son and our lives have benefited greatly from JMS, as I hope yours will too.</p>
			<p>Thank you, Melissa Miller</p>

		<p>Furthermore, teachers were afraid to commit to teaching at JMS due to fears that the school would not continue and due to sub-par benefit packages.</p>
		<h3>The Merger Agreement Between Utah School for the Deaf and Jean Massieu School of the Deaf</h3>
		<p>It got to the point that the UDEAL board honestly and completely could not continue. UDEAL also felt that to ensure that the ASL/English bilingual option was more widely available to students in Utah, a merger between JMS and USDB was necessary (thinking that USDB would then be more willing to promote JMS because it would then be part of the system, this had not always been the case). The merge would also ensure more quality special services at JMS, more financial stability, and better salaries/benefits for JMS employees (Stimpson, UAD Bulletin, March 2005).</p>
		<p>Primarily due to a lack of fiscal resources and the unwillingness of Utah School for the Deaf to send parents who wanted the ASL/English Bilingual approach for their children to talk with JMS, Joe Zeidner, an attorney and hearing parent of a deaf daughter, (He joined the UDEAL Board six months later after its establishment in August 1998) lobbied the state legislature to push USD to incorporate the Jean Massieu School program into USD to provide parents more options from which to choose. Unlike former USDB Superintendent Lee Robinson, Linda Rutledge, a superintendent was very supportive of this merger movement.</p>
<p>As a result, during the 2004 legislative session, the Utah State Legislature approved ‘intent language’ saying that the Utah State Board of Education would consider the possibility of merging JMS with USDB (Harrington, 2005). After approximately one year of continuing negotiations, a steering committee developed Letter of Intent and Terms of Agreement documents that would govern the merger of the two organizations (Intent of the Legislature, 2007). The Terms of Agreement outlined the guiding principles and commitments that will ensure the successful merger. The agreement addresses issues related to philosophy and instruction, program, assets and finances, the Jean Massieu School Advisory Council, policies and procedures, human resources, transportation, facility, and organizational structure. As agreed upon, JMS would be a separate school within USD and would answer directly to the USD superintendent (Jean Massieu and Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind Terms of Agreements, 2005).</p>
		<p>For complete details of the Agreement, see General Exhibit No. 9634:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Heading 04/05/2004</p>
			<p>It is the intent of the Legislature that substantial effort be made by the State Superintendent and the State School Board combine the services of USDB and the Jean Massieu Charter School for the deaf. This shall include instruction in American Sign Language as well as bi-lingual and bi-cultural education which will receive administrative support. Representatives from Jean Massieu shall be integrated in a meaningful way into the U.S.D.B. Institutional Council. The State Superintendent shall report to the Education Interim Committee in September 2004 regarding the progress of this intent. If necessary the Education Interim Committee may make recommendations regarding continued funding of Jean Massieu until integration is complete.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Prior to the merger, the Letter of Intent and Terms of Agreements were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Council, Utah Deaf Education and Literacy, and the State Board of Education. Upon approval by the Utah State Board of Education represented by Dr. Patti Harrington, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the documents were signed at JMS on June 3, 2005 by Kim Burningham, Utah State Board of Education Chair, Linda Rutledge, USDB Superintendent (2004-2007), and Craig Radford, UDEAL Chair (Stimpson, UAD Bulletin, July 2005). At this time, Chris Palaia (Deaf), Laurel Stimpson (Deaf), Craig Radford (Deaf), Sean Williford, Joe Ziedner, LaDawn Rinlinsbaker, Jeff Allen, Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz (Deaf), and Jodi B. Kinner (Deaf) were members of the UDEAL Board who witnessed signature of the 2005 USDB/JMS merger.</p>
		<p>Under the JMS administration of Mike Holland, a veteran deaf teacher of Colorado School for the Deaf and Blind, the merger provided an viable option for parents who wished to choose the ASL/English Bilingual Education approach for their deaf and hard of hearing children. There were now three programs available at Utah School for the Deaf: Oral/Aural program, Total Communication program, and the ASL/English Bilingual program as it is now called.</p>
		<p>Since the USD/JMS merger in 2005, the idea of going back to charter school status had been discussed among community members, especially due to continued struggles in ensuring that ASL/English bilingual philosophy was as widely accepted and promoted and respected as it should be. It was not going to be a viable path to take, though, because of the reasons cited above. Attached are the Letter of Intent and Terms of Agreement below.</p>
		<p>ADDENDA A – E Addenda A is an inventory of JMS’ assets such as computers, desks, chairs, and etc. JMS Assets/Inventory document is not included.</p>
		<p>Addenda B is an Organizational Chart. See the attached Organization Chart below.</p>
		<p>Addenda C: is an Appeals Process. See attached Appeals Process document below as well.</p>
		<p>Addenda D: JMS Philosophy was a “fleshing out” of the basic philosophy and beliefs that were included in the original charter that was written by the founders of JMS and proposed/accepted by USOE in June 1998. The document clarifies the original principles that have guided the school throughout its existence, and was developed by Minnie-Mae Wilding-Diaz, JMS co-founder, Dr. Cynthia Plue, a Deaf individual, and Jodi Becker Kinner to document and strengthen the ASL/English bilingual philosophy and beliefs. In addition to that, the intention of the JMS philosophy document is to preserve and maintain the history and original purposes of JMS. It was JMS’ aim to remain true to the basic ASL and English Bilingual Education philosophy and tenets that were formed when the school was established.</p>
		<p>Addenda E: Hiring Practices was developed by Minnie-Mae Wilding-Diaz and Jodi Becker Kinner for the USDB/JMS merge. The purpose of the hiring guidelines was to enable JMS to continue to hire high quality teachers who are fluent in American Sign Language as well as in English, have expressive and receptive communication skills in ASL, and have expertise in the ASL-English Bilingual Approach to Deaf Education. However, USDB adapted our hiring procedures into their hiring guidelines, and to be fair, USDB included other educational programs in guidelines.</p>

			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>Joe Ziedner was a former member of the Institutional Council for the Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind. His position in 1997 had helped him to not only understand his daughter, Jessica, but also the big picture in the school system. He said two Deaf members, Dr. Robert G. Sanderson and Dennis Platt had influenced him greatly and helped him understand the deaf world and the contrasts in hearing and deaf views on the education of deaf children (Mortensen, UAD Bulletin, July 1997).</p>
		</aside>
		<h3>Bias Toward Communication Modes and Methodology Still Continue</h3>
		<p>The merge provided an option for parents who wish to choose the ASL/English Bilingual Education approach for their deaf and hard of hearing children, and became the third option available at Utah School for the Deaf, in addition to their Oral and Total Communication programs. It was hoped the merge would enable parents to have more choices. However, it had not always happened. For example, before Melissa Jensen, a hearing mother of a deaf daughter, met with staff members from USD in 2006 to discuss educational placement options for her three-year-old daughter, she had heard about Jean Massieu School. However, at the meeting, she was presented with two options: Oral and Total Communication. No information about USD’s third program, JMS and its ASL/English bilingual program, was shared. Moreover, when Melissa asked about JMS, she was actually told, "No, you don't want her [her daughter] to go there! Don't you want her sent to TC? It has everything you could want." Moreover, she was erroneously told that it was against JMS policy and philosophy to provide speech services, and that children with cochlear implants were not allowed at JMS.
		<p>Melissa was told that her daughter could succeed in an oral classroom and that if she didn't then they could consider moving her to a signing class. Melissa asked if the teacher would understand the signs her daughter already had and was told that everybody at USD could understand a little but they would never sign back and that within a short time, the daughter would stop signing. Melissa was also told that if her daughter didn't learn to talk by the time she was 3 or 4 she would never be able to learn (Melissa Jensen, 2007, personal communication, name used with permission). This story, which happened in 2006, reflects the history of bias that USD had, and of the continued bias at USD as a result of the history.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>October 29, 2009<br>To whom it may concern,</p>
			<p>My name is Melissa Jensen. I am the mother of a 6 year old, Deaf daughter who is in first grade. My daughter Katrina was identified as having a progressive hearing loss when she was 18 months old. Our family was served by PIP and the Deaf mentor program from her identification until she aged out at 3 years old.</p>
			<p>At the time of her transition, Katrina had a bilateral moderately-severe hearing loss. ASL was her primary language, but as hearing parents we also wanted Katrina to become a spoken language user. In preparation for choosing her preschool, we had our “pre-transition” meeting with our PIP advisor and a USD staff member. When we told the staff member that we were signing with our daughter, she told us that we would want to place our daughter in the TC program at USD. She never mentioned JMS, or told us that there was another option. Luckily, our PIP advisor had a Deaf daughter herself, who attended JMS. She told us that there was another option for our daughter. When we brought JMS up to the USD staff member, she was EXTREMELY negative. She told us several untruths about JMS. She told us that Katrina may not be allowed at JMS because she wore hearing aids. She told us that Katrina was not “deaf enough” to go to JMS because she was “only” moderately-severe hard of hearing. She also told us that JMS did not provide speech therapy. None of these things were true.</p>
			<p>After visiting all the preschool options, we decided that JMS was the least restrictive environment for Katrina, and we held the placement meeting. The same USD staff member was in attendance at that meeting. She took all of Katrina’s paperwork, and crossed out the word “Deaf” which we had written and changed it to “hard of hearing”. I found that slightly offensive, because we embrace the Deaf community as part of our daughter’s life, and I saw that as implying that Katrina should be labeled as “hard of hearing” because that is somehow “better” than being “Deaf”.</p>
			<p>At the same meeting, the staff member saw Katrina’s audiogram for the first time. She was very surprised at how well aided she was. She burst out saying “She can HEAR! She could SUCCEED!” It was very clear that what the staff member meant was “She can hear. She can become oral and THAT is what success is.”</p>
			<p>In my family’s experience, USD is extremely biased, and biased toward oralism. We were never told about JMS as an option, we were actually told lies about the program. We were lucky enough to have a PIP advisor who gave us all the information, and who was a fluent ASL user, but if we hadn’t I don’t know where my daughter would be today. Our decisions were not respected by USD staff, and more than once it was clear that USD believed that success was measured by the ability to speak.</p>
			<p>I hope that changes are in store for USD, so that parents can get ALL the information. I believe in parental choice, but I believe it should be a fully informed choice. I believe that parents should be given fair and accurate information about language choices, methodology, and outcomes for those choices.</p>
			<p>Sincerely,<br>Melissa Jensen</p>

		<p>NOTE: This letter was submitted to Dr. Martall Menlove on October 29, 2009, two months after Steven W. Noyce was hired as the USDB Superintendent.  This was one story out of several and made it apparent that many parents were still not being given the complete picture of the educational methodologies available to their children. Furthermore, apparently some key personnel at USD were still proponents of oralism and mainstreaming over the linguistically rich environment available at JMS. Could this have been alleviated had Utah State of Education and Utah School for the Deaf followed through with Dr. Campbell’s recommendation of developing Parent Orientation and Student Placement Procedure and providing pamphlets explaining the two programs and their different communication methodologies? One can wonder.</p>
		<p>Despite the 1970 and 1977 policy mandated by the USBE and USD Communication Guidelines approved unanimously by the Institutional Council in 1998, the parents were still not being fully informed in an unbiased manner about the ASL option. On March 18, 1998, the Institutional Council approved the new Communication Guidelines to address important communication needs and included several important features. With the existing Total Communication and Oral Programs, the Guidelines permitted parents to have more educational choices. The alternative types of classes may be added by the administration with the approval of the Institutional Council. Additionally, the Guidelines required the IEP team to give the parents or the student if of majority age, a current copy of the Communication Guidelines during the IEP meeting annually. The IEP had to include a statement initialed by the parent indicating they have received a copy, that any questions regarding it have been answered, and that they understand the Guidelines (Horn, UAD Bulletin, May 1998). However, one of the alternative type of classes did not apply to JMS if parents and/or students choose to attend there. Prior to the 2005 USDB/JMS merger, JMS as a public charter school option was not included in the USD’s IEP list as one of the continuum of school placement options.</p>
		<p>Since the USD/JMS merger, the parents were also still not being fully informed about the ASL/English Bilingual program offered at JMS. This seemed ironic since the JMS has merged with USD to become its signing option for parents and students. In fact, many parents learn about JMS from outside sources, rather than from USD professionals. It seems that the cycle that kept parents from considering the simultaneous/total communication programs in the USD system in the past was repeating itself in regards to keeping parents and students from considering the programs offered through JMS. It was hoped that the merger would enable parents to have more real choices. The question was: “Has this happened? Do parents and deaf students have real choices now at USD?”</p>
		<p>In 2007, the biased situation led to the formation of the Hands and Voices Chapter in Utah by Mindi Allen, the wife of Jeff Allen, JMS co-founder. The Utah Hands and Voices Chapter is affiliated with Hands and Voices, a nationwide non-profit organization dedicated to supporting families and their children who are deaf or hard of hearing, as well as the professionals who serve them. Hands and Voices is a parent-driven, parent/professional collaborative group that is unbiased towards communication modes and methods. Its slogan is, “What works for your child is what makes the choice right.” As for the Utah Hands & Voices Chapter, it offers a wide range of activities, play groups and so much more.</p>
		<h3>The Merger of the Total Communication Program with Jean Massieu School</h3>
		<p>In spring 2008, JMS merged with the Total Communication program of USD (elementary school level only). The merge came about because of the Total Communication teachers. Over the course of many years, the teachers of the Total Communication program had evolved from using SimCom and Signed English to applying a bilingual/bicultural approach (as it was entitled several years ago) in their classrooms. They had long known about the ineffectiveness of SimCom and using Signed English, so they hadn't used it in a long time. Moreover, most of the teachers had been trained at Utah State University which emphasizes a bilingual/bicultural approach. One other factor for the merge was that over the course of many years, the Total Communication program had constantly moved from location to location, never staying long at one location. The teachers knew that if they remained at the last location, they would have one fewer classroom and that meant three teachers sharing a classroom instead of two teachers like what was already happening. That prospect didn't please the teachers, so they advocated very strongly that this was the year to merge, especially when JMS was moving too.</p>
		<p>Keeping the kids in separate schools put an undue strain on teachers in both programs. When they were separated, many grade levels had to be combined to justify a class. To Total Communication teachers, merging with JMS made sense because then they could officially apply the ASL/English bilingual approach in their classrooms and they could provide at least one class of students at each grade level, which is better for the students and the teachers. They also knew that by merging with JMS, the students peer group would expand; which helps language growth. When separate, both programs suffered, but combined, they were able to provide a stronger ASL/English bilingual school.</p>
		<p>Since the Total Communication Program and JMS had merged under a new, JMS deaf administrator, Jill Radford, the teachers noticed the children seemed happier. One of the teachers, Michelle Tanner, who was a member of the Institutional Council representing the USDB teachers, loved watching the large group of students playing at recess time. She noticed that several of the Total Communication students were becoming more self-confident about their identities and that the Total Communication teachers were happy to have an identity. Tanner loved having more teachers to work with. This helped the teachers bounce ideas off of more people for lessons.</p>
		<p>Now JMS was also able to provide more after school activities for the students and the teachers were able to advocate better because the numbers were greater (Michelle Tanner, personal communication, July 8, 2011).</p>
		<h3>An Impact of Jean Massieu School on Utah School for the Deaf</h3>
		<p>Since the Utah School for the Deaf and Jean Massieu School merger in 2005, JMS had an impact on Utah School for the Deaf. When JMS was established as a charter school in 1999, the Center for ASL/English Bilingual Education Research training was sought out and finally became a reality after the merge with Utah Schools for the Deaf and Blind in 2005. The long awaited professional development for teacher of deaf and hard of hearing students had finally come to Utah in 2007. Formerly known as the STAR school project, the Center for ASL/English Bilingual Education Research established a nationwide professional development program promoting and validating the use of American Sign Language and English (written and when appropriate spoken) in deaf classrooms. The professional development became called ASL/English Bilingual Professional Development. Through this training, teachers of the deaf and hard of hearing met weekly for seminars that provide research about the best practice for use of ASL/English bilingual in deaf education (Jill Radford, personal communication, June 22, 2009). Eventually, the teachers from the North Division in Ogden and Skyline High School in Salt Lake City joined both CEABER and AEBPD training sessions.</p>
		<p>The Total Communication program in name only had since been practicing the ASL/English bilingual approach to teaching deaf children. As a result, one of the teachers from their program joined one of the JMS teachers to attend the training at Gallaudet. Michelle Tanner, a teacher from the TC program agreed to be transferred to JMS since the proposal was to start the training for JMS teachers only. No one could had predicted the impact this decision would make on the deaf education programs in the state of Utah. The teachers in the TC program had been advocating for the use of ASL/English bilingual approach for deaf children. They experienced much of the same resistance that JMS did when established as a charter school. When the training for ASL/English bilingual professional development was introduced and seminars started, two teachers from the TC program “fought” to participate. From that point on the similarities between the TC program and JMS became more evident. The teachers became more united and were able to exchange ideas and strategies that would help foster literacy and signacy for their students (Jill Radford, personal communication, June 22, 2009).</p>
		<p>One common goal among the teachers of the TC program and JMS was the need for larger peer groups for their students. Teachers realized that peer interaction is critical for the educational success of students who are deaf and hard of hearing. With moves for both the TC and JMS school due in the fall of 2008, the teachers of the TC program advocated for the merge of the TC program with the JMS school. Emphasizing that they had only been a TC program in name only but had practiced the ASL/English philosophy in their classrooms. Thus in the fall of 2008, the TC program joined the JMS school family. Student enrollment grew and peer interactions became abundant.</p>
		<p>The merge between the TC program and JMS had been a success. The students were thriving in a language rich environment where their language and culture was valued and language was accessible throughout the whole school. This was the most significant impact the AEBPD training had had on the state of Utah (Jill Radford, personal communication, June 22, 2009).</p>
		<p>Another impact this training has had in Utah was educating people about the need for ASL as the primary language for children who are deaf and hard of hearing. Presentations have been made at the Deaf Summit Conference here in Utah. People are eager for more information in relation to the AEBPD training (Jill Radford, personal communication, June 22, 2009).</p>
		<p>Another impact of this training is that two other teachers from USDB were sent to Gallaudet to become mentor teachers for teachers in the Ogden area. The training has been in high demand and people are seeking for improvement for the education of students who are deaf and hard of hearing in Utah (Jill Radford, personal communication, June 22, 2009).</p>
		<p>Ultimately, under the wing of Utah School for the Deaf, JMS as an ASL/English bilingual day school had taken “center stage” because what happened at JMS was symbolic of what was happening with ASL/English bilingual programs at USDB as a whole. JMS was obviously the largest group of ASL/English bilingual students and teachers at USDB. If conditions were not good there, they were not good for any and all ASL/English bilingual programs at USDB. Along the same lines of thought, it could also be said that if perspectives towards JMS get better, they will improve elsewhere as well (Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz, personal communication, November 19, 2010).</p>
		<p>JMS was also viewed as a “beacon” of USD. Since 2005, JMS had made a huge impact on USD such as providing the CEABER/AEBPD training, re-establishing the Athletic program, merging the Total Communication program to JMS obtaining a permanent school building in the Salt Lake area, providing a Student Body Government for students, and lastly, supervising the Deaf USD Programs from both Churchill Middle School and Skyline High School under the administration of Jill Radford.</p>
		<h3>Biased Toward Placement & Alternative Placement</h3>
		<p>However, not everyone supported the Utah School for the Deaf and Jean Massieu School merger. This merge was feared by the JMS teachers, staff, and the Deaf community. They worried that USD would eliminate the ASL/English bilingual approach to teaching. They also feared that JMS may be “swallowed” by USD and its ASL/English bilingual program would be lost. Additionally, similar to the total communication program, it was feared that JMS would be treated as a last resort. USD’s former Superintendent Linda Rutledge, who made the merge go into effect, clarified her view that JMS’ ASL/English bilingual education is a valuable component of the overall program that USD offers (Jeff Pollock, personal communication, May 3, 2006).</p>
		<p>Prior the USD/JMS merger, parents were still not being given the complete picture of the educational methodologies available to children despite the policy being exacted in 1970 and 1977 as well as USDB Communication Guidelines being passed in 1998. In 2002, Ron Nelson, UAD president along with UAD members, Dr. Robert G. Sanderson, Dennis Platt and Kristi Mortensen met with USDB Superintendent Lee Robinson and Steve Noyce, a Program Director of the Central Division to address these same concerns of the oral/aural bias at the school. Dr. Robinson expressed his desire for the oral and total communication programs to be balanced (Mortensen, UAD Bulletin, October 2002). Moreover, he stated that Parent Advisors of the Parent Infant Program should be sharing different educational options with parents without leaving any information out or showing a bias (Mortensen, UAD Bulletin, October 2002).</p>
		<p>Despite the Superintendent Lee’s stand and Steve Noyce being witness, apparently no progress had been made in the last seven years. Parents continued to be frustrated with the bias and inappropriate placement decisions occurring at their child’s IEP meetings. Sometimes placements have been changed by USD professionals without consulting parents (Hands & Voices parents, 2007, personal communication). It seems, in the minds of some USD personnel, the preference of placing all deaf and hard of hearing children in mainstreamed or oral/aural settings had taken root.</p>
		<p>Like Dr. Campbell, a Special Education attorney named Lawrence Siegel (hearing) emphasizes the importance of providing full disclosure to parents regarding information about hearing loss and about oral and visual communication options. This includes the difference between “receiving” language and effectively “using” language.</p>
		<h3>Sound Beginnings of Cache Valley, Logan, Utah</h3>
		<p>When the Sound Beginnings of Cache Valley, a multimillion-dollar was opened at Utah State University in Logan, Utah on May 3, 2007, the Deaf community wondered if that was the right way to go. Some members of Deaf community were worried by the auditory-verbal therapy focus taken by a new program designed to help the deaf learn to listen and speak with cochlear implants rather than sign language. The Sound Beginnings relied on cochlear implants, small, complex electronic devices that can help to provide a sense of sound to a person who is profoundly deaf or severely hard of hearing (Lambert, 2007).</p>
		<p>Currently, the Sound Beginnings program was part of a tuition-free, early childhood educational program housed on Utah State’s campus for deaf children from birth to age 5. The goal of the program was to allow them to succeed alongside hearing peers, without the need for sign language. Deaf children were accessed to specialists in early childhood deaf education, pediatric audiology and speech-language pathology (Lambert, 2007).</p>
		<p>Dr. Karl White, a USU psychology professor started the National Center for Hearing and Assessment. It was a headquarter office at USU for the national level, which had dramatically improved early detection of hearing loss across the United States. While traveling nationwide, Dr. White got an eyeful of those who received a cochlear implant early and enter a quality oral program had achieved the ability to function in a classroom without a hearing aid by around age 7 (Lambert, 2007).</p>
		<p>Although Dr. White had no knowledge of Deaf education, his observation of deaf children in nationwide motivated him to solicit $3 million in grant money from a private foundation, Oberkotter Foundation and USU to fund the Sound Beginnings program (Lambert, 2007; Kristi Mortensen, personal communication, June 26, 2009). The Oberkotter Foundation is the largest foundation in America that focus aural-oral education of children who are deaf or hard of hearing. The funding source allows this program to be a tuition-free, early childhood educational program (Kristi Mortensen, personal communication, June 26, 2009).</p>
		<p>The Oberkotter Foundation also gave Dr. White money to start and run a college training program for speech-language pathologists and audiologists with a focus on cochlear implant technology and auditory-verbal therapy techniques. USU had also given them money for full time positions in Communicative Disorders/Deaf Ed Department (Kristi Mortensen, personal communication, June 26, 2009).</p>
		<p>Dr. Paula Pittman expressed frustration that USU cannot seem to come up with full time positions for anyone at SKI-HI, but they had provided at least three full time positions for the Sound Beginnings program. USU was aware that that if Dr. White had success with what he was doing, Oberkotter will continue to provide ongoing foundation dollars in huge amongst, so the university just sees dollar signs (Kristi Mortensen, personal communication, June 26, 2009).</p>
		<p>Dr. White clarified that children in the program who use sign language won't be told to stop, but will not be encouraged to use it for fear it would become a crutch and reduce their chances of mastering spoken English, when in fact the research indicates the exact opposite &#8212; a child who has initially mastered his or first language in sign language does eventually promote speech development (Lambert, 2007)</p>
		<p>Another USU professor of the Department of Deaf Education, Dr. Freeman King opposed the program. He spent years building up USU's influential deaf education program and other top programs around the country that relied on the importance of utilizing American Sign Language and fluency in reading and writing English (Lambert, 2007).</p>
		<p>Dr. King emphasized that, "Speech should not be the end product of the education of a deaf child. It can be a valuable tool, but the most important is access to language.” He also stated that, "This can be achieved through the use of American Sign Language, whereby we are playing to the child's strength, which is vision, and not to their weakness, which is the inability to hear” (Lambert, 2007).</p>
		<p>Kristi Mortensen, a Ph.D. candidate and member of the Deaf community expressed her disappointment of the Sound Beginnings program. She clarified that she was not against the deaf gaining speech. Because of years working with the deaf and as a deaf woman herself, she believed it was essential for deaf children to have a strong grasp of ASL and fluency in reading and writing English so they can function in the hearing world (Lambert, 2007).</p>
		<p>Even the founders of the program acknowledge the implants do not allow the children to hear in the usual sense of the word, they would still not encourage sign language. Mortensen asked, "What if the implants don't work?" She stated said that while cochlear implants are excellent options for those who lost their hearing, they're less likely to succeed for those born deaf. She emphasized that while sign language can be naturally acquired by the deaf, speech never can (Lambert, 2007). While the Utah Association of the Deaf’s official position didn’t declare the implants were wrong, it expressed concern with misconceptions that they were seen as a quick fix or a cure for being deaf (Lambert, 2007).</p>
		<p>However, the Sound Beginnings program had a strong support of leaders in the world of early hearing detection screenings and oral-only education. One of the leaders, Todd Houston, a former director the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing became a new director of Sound Beginnings. He stated, "Our goal is to transition (children) into their public school as soon as possible, but make sure they can be successful in a public school environment," Houston said. "I think many children today &#8212; most children today &#8212; could be successful with a spoken language approach” (Lambert, 2007).</p>
		<p>Beth Foley, a head of the Communicative Disorders and Deaf Education at USU believed the program will provide an alternative for deaf children and their families, not replace the department's sign language training program. She said "An oral-auditory focus is right for some families and not right for others.” She also stated, "We already have a strong sign-language program. Now we are expanding the options we have out there for parents” (Lambert, 2007).</p>
		<p>Houston agreed with her comments and said, "Parents can, and should, be able to choose how they want to communicate with their children.” "The fact is that 90 percent of all newborns with permanent hearing loss are born to hearing parents, and with all of the advances in the field, most of these parents want to communicate via spoken language. Many parents are now choosing to get their children cochlear implants, and these children need intensive follow-up training and services to take full advantage of this technology” (Lambert, 2007).</p>
		<p>A range of strong opinions were expressed by parents on the best options for deaf children. One of the parents, Taunya Paxton decided cochlear implants was the right option for her deaf son, as well as a focus almost entirely on English after much research She stated, "We would do sign language, and he would just talk, so we were just like, 'He would like to talk” (Lambert, 2007).</p>
		<p>Another parent, Jennifer Tingey of two deaf children who recently attended a presentation by Sound Beginnings, she decided against it. She said she was upset because she felt like those who led the discussion glossed over the program's potential negatives. Hence, Tingey decided on a total communication program for her children. She stated, "They're getting speech and sign language so, when they're old, they've been given both and can choose whichever they would like," she said. Tingey expressed her concerns by saying, "With Sound Beginnings, they don't use ASL in their classroom. I can see their point of view of not using ASL as a crutch if their parents want them to be hearing, but if that child doesn't have a cochlear implant in, how can you communicate with that child, because when the child's swimming or in the bathtub, they have to take the implant out” (Lambert, 2007).</p>
		<p>While a group of interested people waited for hard proof, one group advocated for deaf culture and giving children sign language options, while the other gave parents the option of intervening when a child is young and most able to be taught speech after getting a cochlear implant (Lambert, 2007).</p>
		<p>All those years, UAD had worked hard to form a new deaf education program with an emphasis of sign language in a postsecondary institution in Utah. In 1985, a new deaf education program at Utah State University was finally established and its emphasis was in Total Communication approaches. It was not until 1991 when that program was re-structured to reflect an ASL/English bilingual education. Ever since, the teachers had a choice to either enroll at the ASL/English bilingual education at Utah State University or the University of Utah in the Special Education program with an emphasis in Hearing Impairments (oral education approaches). Nowadays Utah State University had formed a Sound Beginnings School, an oral education curriculum that was implemented in the Deaf Education program. The teachers who wish to major in the oral education can either select Utah State University or University of Utah while other teachers who prefer ASL/English bilingual can go to Utah State University or other university outside of the state.</p>
		<h3>The Oral Deaf Education Meeting at the Utah State University</h3>
		<p>On May 3, 2007, the Oral Deaf Education meeting was held at Utah State University. The room was well-packed, and some deaf people sitting in front, with two interpreters. No space left for sitting except one to two seats in the back.</p>
		<p>Director Todd Houston shared the audience about the grant, called “Sound Beginnings of Cache Valley.” The $3 million initiative will have what is called an auditory-oral focus, which means the program will focus on developing spoken language and listening skills. Superintendent Linda Rutledge of Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind was presented along with some of the USDB representatives.</p>
		<p>Todd Houston and Beth Foley demonstrated the DVD comprised of parents, teachers, administrative staff, and team of specialists as "partners in a well-round supportive system" to make these children "successfully orally educated" in such an "normal, ordinary, independent, happy environment" &#8212; having them to get the "great sense of independence" in the "very mainstreamed" settings.</p>
		<p>Superintendent Linda Rutledge presented how Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind proudly serve the Oral Deaf Education as one of three options in the state of Utah and then she left the meeting right away with one of the administrators. A quite small of audience members clapped.</p>
		<p>Jean Moog, a director of The Moog Center for Deaf Education in St. Louis, Missouri and a strong international oral leader, indicated that she did not realize that the state of Utah was such a scenic state with mountain settings, and she would love to come back here often for wintertime to go skiing &#8212; she kept marveling how breathtaking it was for her to be here, etc for about 10 minutes, and then she further notified that the Oral Deaf Ed was very strongly influenced in St Louis, thus requiring parents of deaf and hard of hearing children to move there for strong parental community support. She encouraged the audience to have a positive, strong relationship with the Oral Deaf Education community and that would make a positive impact on having this program successfully consistent with its philosophy &#8212; where they could provide "near native" Oral environment for deaf and hard of hearing students at all times. She further indicated that with economic hardships in a way for other parents who were not able to move to St Louis, she came up with strategies to establish more Moog Training Centers under her Moog Curriculum in other states and establishing one in South America. The goal was to develop and establish eight projects nationally. Moog expressed her excitement about seeing this happening nationally and internationally. At end of her speech, there was a large number of clapping.</p>
		<p>Two sets of local parents shared their experiences of their child with cochlear implants. One in Box Elder County area, (complaining that there was no services in her area, and she was delighted to see one in her area), and one had to move to St Louis for the best oral deaf educational setting. The 2nd set of parents showed off their deaf daughter's oral skills as she sang the "Itsy Bitsy Spider" song. Everyone applauded.</p>
		<p>The panel discussion was held comprising of parents of children with cochlear implants, professionals, and a moderator. A note for the audience was to write down any questions on index cards, and turn them in right before the panel discussion soon.</p>
		<p>Starting with a list of four frequent answers and questions concerning how the program starts, etc. The Sound Beginnings program was currently taking children who were deaf and hard of hearing (targeted children between ages of birth and 5 yrs because of federal monies) as a part of intake procedures, and they planned on having them enrolled in the program this September 2007. Children whose age range from birth to 24 months old will have a family visit once a week; children whose age range between 24 and 36 months will have a weekly playgroup. Children whose age between 3 and 5 yrs will be enrolled in the program all day. 1st three years, these students get this free. They will work out the last two years (4-5 yrs of age) for fund, but will aim for the local public school educational settings. Their goal was to increase family involvement as part of this program as much as possible, working with parents as partners with a team of specialists, including the USU students and professionals (audiology, speech, medical, teaching, etc) as part of the training.. They said they will respect and recognize their choice of communication methods, however, they will respond to them "orally." They planned on setting up a diagnostic based approach, allowing them to present and demonstrate the usage of measured assessment tools to make them "orally successfully educated" on a daily basis.</p>
		<p>A deaf parent of a deaf child asked how he can educate this to his deaf child in that setting. One of these professionals on the panel "rebutted" that "if needed, they will provide interpreters" to meet the child's communicative needs! Also, a parent of a child with cochlear implants on the panel indicated that we need to build a strong parental community just like the “Moog System in St Louis” &#8212; a strong "non hearing impaired" community – Dr. Cynthia Plue, a Deaf representative of the Deaf community did not understand what he meant by that, and the moderator wouldn’t take any impromptu questions. One parent on that panel indicated that she wished that her daughter, then three-and-a-half years old, should be implanted at age of two-and-a-helf years old, but it was too late. She strongly recommended that parents should implant their child earliest or soonest as possible to acquire better language skills.</p>
		<p>Dr. Plue wrote critical questions, "Where are the successful adults with CIs?”; “Where are they? They should be exposed themselves to the public as the 'role models' for this program."; " What are they doing for a living?”; “What are their inputs on this program?”; “Will this allow ample opportunity to have them educated bilingually: ASL and English?" on the index cards. However, the moderator did not use her questions during the panel discussion. "That was very frustrating, but very smart to have it "controlled" in their "oral deaf ed based" ways!” she said (Dr. Cynthia Plue, personal communication, May 1, 2009).</p>
		<p>While the Sound Beginnings of Cache Valley was in the process of being established at Utah State University, a number of articles were published in the newspapers expressing concerns and perspectives regarding the preschool program.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Sign language wrongly ignored</p>
			<p>To the editor:</p>
<p>I am one of those “deaf parents” who stood up and commented concerning sign language not being used in the Sound Beginnings of Cache Valley. I understand that they are offering alternative services for those children with hearing loss such as my son, but as you look around, there is no other choice in Cache Valley except the Sound Beginnings, which is not right.</p>
			<p>I am one of those two million Deaf Americans who look at deafness without shame. We look at ourselves as an ethic group rather than a group with disability or a group that needs their hearing to be fixed, which is how Sound Beginnings looks at us. We are rich in culture, folklore, history, heritage, and language.</p>
			<p>We are similar to African-Americans and other ethnic groups in the United States that, unfortunately, have gone through persecution and discrimination, except that ours have not been as violent as others. Such persecution and discrimination is easily seen at the meeting with Sound Beginnings of Cache Valley as they underestimate sign language and in fact ban them from using it in their classroom. That is an action of genocide. By focusing on speech only they rob us of our culture, heritage and easily accessible language, ASL. American Sign Language (ASL) was proven by William Stokoe to be a true and natural language in 1979. It is not inferior to any spoken language, but is made to look so by programs such as Sound Beginnings.</p>
			<p>I wonder if I should walk in a classroom with hearing children who wanted to learn sign language as is found among parents of infants and/or toddlers. If I follow Sound Beginning of Cache Valley, I would simply ban them from using their native language, English, and begin to teach them sign language with the assistance of technology such as robotic parts installed in their hands in order to get them to make the right sign. How would you feel? That’s exactly what we feel; we do not need technology to fix our ears.</p>
			<p>I have never spoken one word in my lifetime but am able to maintain above a 3.5 GPA at USU. What is wrong with sign language? What is wrong being deaf? Nothing; as for someone seeking for “normal” status such as parents with deaf children, may I ask, what is normal? Is a left-handed person normal in contrast to a right-handed? Are person’s skin colors normal such as olive, peach, brown, etc.? Is a person normal with or without eyeglasses or eye contacts? What is normal anyway?</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Sign Language</p>
			<p>To the Editor:</p>
			<p>A cochlear implant is not simply a “magnetic pad and thin cables” connected to the auditory nerve. It is an electronic device implanted beneath the skin during an invasive surgery. The magnetic pad and thin cable are the visible part. Cochlear implants do not restore normal hearing. They simulate sounds. Children with cochlear implants will never have normal hearing.</p>
			<p>This information is clearly explained by cochlear implant companies. A child born deaf will always be deaf even if they use hearing aids or have a cochlear implant. The fact is, if they do hear some sound (through assistive technology) it is not what we, as hearing people, are used to hearing.</p>
			<p>This, however, does not impede the deaf child. I am a mother of a deaf child. He is 9 months old and can say the words, “more,” “please,” and “milk.” He uses his hands to say these words. I understand him and give him what he needs. When my child is ready for preschool he will have over 300 signs. However there is no preschool classroom in Cache Valley where my child will be able to go and have someone understand him and be able to respond in his own language (American Sign Language) to teach him the same things other children are learning. We can choose to send him to a special education classroom taught by someone with limited sign skills or send him to the new program, Sound Beginnings, that USU is starting fall 2007. Although many of the staff of this new program may know “some sign,” it will not be used in the program to enhance my son’s learning. When he signs, his teachers would not understand him, would not be able to respond back and build on the language he is giving them.</p>
			<p>The Communicative Disorders and Deaf Education department has said that with this program they are expanding the existing program they have and offering more options for parents of deaf children. I see no option for my son. There is no classroom where he can go and learn to speak as well as learn emergent literacy skills, social skills, and basic knowledge of the world around him through a language that is easily accessible to him. Why not provide a Bilingual/Bicultural approach where deafness is accepted, not shunned.</p>
			<p>Where a child is allowed an accessible language (ASL) as well as taught to read, write and speak English. If allowed, deaf children will excel in both ASL and English, growing up to be fully active adults contributing to society in a truly unique and wonderful way. Deaf children in Cache Valley need this opportunity.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Outright Lies</p>
			<p>To the Editor</p>
<p>Outright lies were spoken at the meeting about an oral education program for deaf kids less than five years old, called Sound Beginnings of Cache Valley, which was held last Friday, April 27th at USU.</p>
<p>The first lie is all deaf children all over the United States speak well. My speech was awful until adulthood despite my speech training I got from infancy through 8th grade. Many more deaf have far worse speech than I do.  </p>
			<p>The second lie is all deaf children are happily mainstreamed at public schools and have normal relationships with hearing pupils. I notice the movie, shown at the Sound Beginnings of Cache Valley meeting, omits deaf children in middle and high school years. I had fun playing with neighborhood children daily until I was eleven, when they switched from playing kid games to mostly chatting. They excluded me from chats due to my poor lip-reading skills. One day we walked around our block, smelling flowers. While I was bending down and smelling them, they all ran off. I just walked home and became best friends with books from then on.</p>
			<p>The third lie is once children learn to speak, they stop signing. I attended an intensive oral school from three years old to fourteen years old. At reunions every five years, all 250 or so of us but three alumni students use ASL despite their good speech!</p>
			<p>  The fourth lie is that Cochlear Implants are helpful. If that is the case then why there are so many deaf people get rid of theirs when they reach adulthood?  </p>
			<p>The fifth lie is that Savannah and other two children shown on the video and in person who shows up at the meeting all started with American Sign Language (ASL) and then progressed to good speech. What about those who didn’t started with ASL? It took me SIX months to learn how to pronounce my first word, “ball.” What a waste of time! In contrast deaf children exposed to ASL usually have a vocabulary in ASL equals to a hearing children’s spoken vocabulary. Those who know ASL learned to speak faster because receptive language skills precede expressive skills, and ASL is visual and easier to understand than oral speech that is largely invisible to the deaf.  </p>
			<p>The sixth lie is oral children are successful in the hearing world. Then why did Utah School for the Deaf and Blind, who supports oral/auditory approach more than other approaches, often fails to produce college-bound students for so long? Oral education still limits students’ access to communication in the classrooms. I was the only deaf in my school from 9th grade through college and got generally 2.7 GPA in high school but mostly 2.0 GPA at college. After I learned ASL at age of 20 years old and attended graduate school with interpreter services, I got 4.0 GPA, thanks to my enhanced access to communication.</p>

			<p>Deaf Ed Article Needs Clarification</p>
			<p>To the Editor:</p>
			<p>This letter is in response to the article that appeared in the Saturday, April 28, 2007, edition of the Herald Journal titled, “USU starting new deaf ed program for kids under 5.”</p>
			<p>It is evident from statements made in the article, that certain misunderstandings need to be addressed.</p>
			<p>The Deaf Education Program at Utah State University is not a “signing” program or a “sign language training program”; rather it is a nationally known teacher training program that places a primary emphasis on the use of American Sign Language as the language most accessible for the deaf child with which English as a second language is paralleled. Also, the statement made in the article that the teacher of the deaf should know “some sign language” is akin to saying that the teacher of English should know some English.</p>
			<p>The Deaf Education Program at Utah State University has a national reputation in the field of deaf education. The program is well known not only for training teachers who are skilled in the use of American Sign Language (ASL), but who are also skilled in teaching methodology and good teaching practices, and, is one of the few programs in the nation that has been granted three areas of certification by Council on Education of the Deaf: Early Childhood, Elementary Education, and Secondary Education.</p>
			<p>The Deaf Education Program embraces the bilingual/bicultural approach in educating the deaf child, an educational approach that embodies the use of two languages, American Sign Language (ASL) and English, and an understanding of and respect for two cultures, the hearing culture and the deaf culture. Goals of the Bilingual/bicultural approach include: 1) using ASL to increase the knowledge of content information; 2) developing transfer strategies from ASL to English in order to gain information; and 3) developing a strong metalinguistic awareness of English and how it is used in different settings and situations. The idea is that literacy in English can be achieved by first providing the deaf child opportunities to acquire a visual language (ASL), and then bridging from this language to the written form of English. The bilingual/bicultural approach does not exclude the learning of speech and listening skills as valuable tools. It is not exclusionary; rather it is inclusive by nature.</p>

		<h3>Sound or Unsound Beginnings: An Option is Not an Option Without Options</h3>
		<p>Dr. J. Freeman King sent this letters to principal of JMS, HCWEC (Henry C. White Educational Council), and many others in USDB:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The recently established oral-aural preschool program for deaf children at Utah State University (Sound Beginnings) came into being due to an extremely generous donation of over 3 million dollars from the Obberkotter Foundation, a national foundation that is exclusionary in its focus—only supporting programs whose emphases are the development of speech and listening skills. The use of American Sign Language is not permitted by faculty or students involved in such a program. Even though much rhetoric has been spent on attempting to convince all involved that the evolution of this program is for the sake of “options for parents of deaf children,” the question begs to be asked, What are the other options? There are none.</p>
			<p>Deaf Education Program at Utah State University has many obvious concerns regarding the oral-aural preschool (Sound Beginnings) and the manner in which it has been conceived, the contrived gestation period, and finally its birth. Discrete meetings, discussions, and conversations occurred the past year as a means of garnering support for the Obberkotter Proposal. The Deaf Education faculty at USU was not privy to any of these meetings, discussions, or conversations. Originally, the proposal was only for an oral-aural preschool, but has metamorphosed to include an oral-aural teacher endorsement program, and will more than likely morph even further to become an oral-aural teacher preparation track.</p>
			<p>The current Deaf Education Program at Utah State University not only considers the views of the victims of exclusively oral-aural programs, but also embraces those views and works to prepare teachers who will not continue the tradition of mediocrity that plagues programs for deaf children. The Deaf Education Program at Utah State University prides itself in preparing teachers who provide deaf children with the very best in terms of linguistic development in American Sign Language and English, and can provide those children with skills and opportunities that will allow them to have choices as they grow up, choices to communicate in American Sign Language or English.</p>
			<p>Too often, deaf children grow up regretting the education they suffered during their childhood. Often professionals in the field and pseudo-deaf educators (psychologists, audiologists, and speech-language pathologists) do not consider the experiences of these deaf children after they are grown (Why is it that the vast majority of oral-aural educated deaf adults choose American Sign Language as their preferred language of communication and linguistic access when they are allowed to make the choice for themselves)? We cannot ignore the fact that many deaf children, even those who do not have severe-to-profound hearing losses, eventually align themselves with the Deaf community, and experience regrets that they did not have the choice or opportunity to have access to a visual language and a different, more positive view of deafness. Why can we not give them the skills to have the best of both worlds right from the beginning?</p>
			<p>In succumbing to the “gift” of millions of dollars from the Obberkotter Foundation, the decision has been made to run roughshod over a nationally-acclaimed program for training teachers of deaf children; to provide a myopic preschool program in the name of parent options; and to initiate a well-funded propaganda campaign in support of the oral-aural preschool and the oral-aural only endorsement/certification track in the Department of Communicative Disorders and Deaf Education. It is dismaying how easily money can be the moving force that causes one to capitulate principles, distort statistical findings, limit parental choice as to educational options, and trample cultural and linguistic respect for a community of American citizens.</p>

			<p>What is an option?</p>
			<p>To the Editor:</p>
			<p>In spite of the recent letter by Karl White stating that Sound Beginnings of Cache Valley is just an option and that their goal is “to assist families who want a spoken language rather than dismiss the value of Deaf culture or the rich history of the Deaf,” the Deaf Community is not satisfied.</p>
			<p>Despite Karl White commented: “We recognize, respect, and appreciate” deaf individual’s culture, language and values. Yet if something is respected and recognized, wouldn’t it be taught in the classroom? Will deaf children, our next generation, be taught about us? Will they be exposed to Deaf adults who could be role models to them? Who will help them to see they can be successful, even if they choose a different language from the hearing majority? Will they learn their accessible language, ASL? Apparently, the answer to these questions is ‘no.’ Quite often, these deaf children would feel their deafness is something they need to be ashamed of and have to work their butt off to hide from everyone, while we have alternative ways to succeed without being ashamed. We have people in our community involved with engineering, computer science, medical services, transportation services and so many other occupations. We strongly believe that we can do anything except hear. Sound Beginnings focuses too much on our weaknesses: listening and speaking, while ignoring so many abilities we have to contribute to society.</p>
			<p>At this time, Sound Beginnings is the only option available to deaf children in Cache Valley. How can parents truly choose to use a spoken language option when there is no other option with which to compare it? Parents can’t go to a classroom here in the valley that uses American Sign Language and see what instruction in this kind of class would provide.</p>
			<p>The Deaf community is working on finding ways to provide another option for deaf children. We truly hope that Karl White and the other staff of Sound Beginnings will be true to their word; that they will work with us to get another option. Then once that option is available, they will work with parents who want both sign language and auditory training for their children, and allow that to happen. Parents need to be given an unbiased choice; to be able to see all approaches in action, and then make an educated decision. Most parents are choosing to give their child both ASL and auditory, truly allowing the child to choose for themselves what works for them. Why shouldn’t they?</p>
			<p>James B. Smith</p>
			<p>This comment is in response to Amy Wusstig's comment:</p>
			<p>Amy is right that parents have the right to choose whither service their deaf child(ren) should receive. However, once parents choose whither service, other than this preschool, they would find out that there is one kind of service available in the valley; this is oral/aural approach preschool called Sound Beginnings. This should not happen, as parents are (not directly) force to choose the preschool recently established because there are no other options available</p>
			<p> I am a parent of deaf child myself, I choose Bilingual/Bicultural approach, and there is none available at present time. Normally once one option is provide, other option(s) should be provide to satisfy parents and their children's needs. This is not happen yet.</p>
			<p>For more details, read my latest post, the one about option as professionals often said they are willing to work with deaf community to extend other options to their already established option.</p>
			<p>There is other thing I want to add to Amy's is her comment, "each family has the right to make that choice for themselves...without telling them that they are wrong."</p>
			<p>Again, parents like me have the right to choose but we cannot change the consequence that follows. That is why deaf community is involved, to GUIDE parents to avoid unwanted or wrongful consequences. Of course, professionals such as audiology and SLP, thinks similar.</p>
			<p>Deaf community is wonderful tools, full of information and experiences as they carry over hundred years of experience and knowledge of how to dealing with deafness, technologies provided by professionals, how to teach deaf children and the like. They are deaf themselves, in large range from Deaf of Deaf parents to Hard of Hearing who can speaks quite well. Deaf community is best place to look, NOT professionals as they think deaf are dumb, can’t function in the hearing society. It is obvious on this article (see Brent Patterson's response).</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>---"Devastating Problems" and "Too Late”---</p>
			<p>I find this article ironic. It says that they're offering what the parents want, but what about the child? If implanted and/or wearing hearing aid, they have to go through intensive speech/hearing therapy during their childhood, well into their teens, because they are incapable of detecting their own mistakes. They require enormous amount of energy, time, and money. Often the child wants to have fun, run around and do fun things, but with implants and hearing aids, they are forced to stay still for an hour or so, listening and attempting to talk. I have a friend who has a cochlear implant, he related to me about his experiences during his childhood. He hated going to the training sessions, he found it boring, and ultimately unbeneficial. Add this to the normal schooling that the child has to attend and his/her free time is cut down severely.</p>
			<p>While there are some success stories, often those who are "successful" learn sign language later in their lives and start interacting with other deaf people. Is this considered a failure or what? I met another deaf friend who was capable of talking clearly, and was able to understand most of the time what an individual was talking about. But when he learned sign language at age of 19, he became involved with the Deaf culture more than the Hearing culture.</p>
			<p>I also found this quote, "If these babies are not identified during the first few months of life and provided with appropriate assistance, hearing loss can cause devastating problems for a child’s language, learning and social development." and this one "Until recently, most children with permanent hearing loss were not identified until they were 2-3 years of age — far too late." too dramatic. “Devastating problems for a child's language, learning, and social development””? Far too late if not detected until 2-3 years of age”? Too late for what? As far as I understand the situation, the author is referring to the fact that a child develops language skill in his/her first three years. If a child is implanted or uses hearing aid, it will take longer for the child to develop listening, comprehension, and language capabilities than a hearing child due to extra training required to help the child use the implant. Whereas if the child is taught sign language, he/she develops all those, and will be able to pick up more language (auditory training or another language) skills. So the bottom line is, if a child is forced to not sign, and use only oral/aural communication, he/she suffers problems developing language. Both sign and oral/aural communication can be taught, but not necessarily at the expense of the other.</p>
			<p>Now, let me refute that warning about "devastating problems" and "too late." I am Deaf myself, and am attending Utah State University. When I was in junior high, my reading level, when tested, was post-college level. I do not face "social and learning" difficulties outside the normal difficulties expected by deafness. I was placed in top 1% of the SAT test result of all students of the age group tested in United States in fields of mathematics and science. And yet I don't talk at all, and I do not use any hearing aid devices. I rely solely on American Sign Language to communicate with peers, and if they are incapable of ASL, I use paper and pencil to communicate with them. I consider myself a satisfied individual who is capable of independent living. All of my family use ASL with me. My parents are hearing, who never had previous experience with Deaf people until my sister and I were born. They learned sign language in order to help us learn language and develop education background.</p>
			<p>Now contrast that to the common tragedy of deaf children who are raised by parents who attempted to "fix" their deafness. Often those children face difficulties learning language because they do not learn one until later in their life. They are forced to endure hours of ineffective speech therapy, and yet the parents refuse to see ASL as an alternative. Deaf people are that, they're deaf, incapable of hearing. Why not go with what they have (sight, feeling, etc) rather than focus on what they don't have? Studies have shown that hearing babies can learn to sign before they can talk and also that they developed language skill earlier than their non-signing counterparts. Yet parents don't apply this to the deaf children. As a result, many of the deaf children who are "fixed" suffer poor grades, poor communication skills, and poor reading skill. I have encountered countless of such deaf people, they are able of speaking only clearly about half the time, have difficulties landing a lucrative career, and ultimately suffer being stuck halfway between hearing and Deaf cultures, unable to find his/her own identity. Is this what parents want for their child? Or is it what the parents wanted in the first place, so that they wouldn't bother learning ASL?</p>
			<p>I hope that the readers of this will be aware that there are alternative options for a deaf child, and that this method is not "one size fits all." I am often sick of hearing that "Deaf people are impaired, they must have implants to succeed in their lives" when I am a living contradiction to that.</p>

			<p>The Henry C. White Educational Council was formed in 2006, but this council did not succeed for various reasons.</p>
		</aside>
	<h3>Utah Code 53A-25-104: The Culprit</h3>
		<p>Since the 1960s and 1970s, the handful of deaf students with multiple disabilities at Utah School for the Deaf and the Blind incrementally increased in numbers at the residential campus in Ogden while more and more deaf students without multiple disabilities were mainstreamed. Often this mainstreaming took the form of self-contained deaf classrooms managed by USD. However those deaf students who were academically above or at grade-level took a different route. They were enrolled in full inclusion programs in their local neighborhood school districts. The Utah Association for the Deaf and the Ogden-Salt Lake City Deaf communities continued to express their dissatisfaction with the quality of education at the Utah School for the Deaf at their own meetings and at the Institutional Council meetings held at the deaf school (Bronwyn O’Hara, personal communication, August 27, 2009).</p>
		<h3>Taking on the System: A Parent’s Perspective—Take 1</h3>
		<p>Because deaf student educational placements had always been handled this way, the Deaf community assumed that the oral teaching methods and the school’s philosophy regarding mainstreaming controlled the placement procedures in both USD and the neighborhood school districts. When discussed forming a day school where the deaf children can be together and enjoy sharing a common language and culture, where parents can learn from the Deaf adults, where Deaf adults are valued, Bronwyn O’Hara, a founder of the Support Group for Deaf Education and a parent of three deaf children however discovered in the Individualized Education Plan meeting that day school cannot and will not ever happen because the Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind was under Special Education. She said if we want a day school, there must be a change in the Utah Code that regulated USDB (O’Hara, UAD Bulletin, January 1995). In 1995, Bronwyn O’Hara wrote an article on this very topic alerting the Deaf community. It was printed in the January issue of the UAD Bulletin. It follows in its entirety:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Right Now, the law says that THE UTAH SCHOOLS FOR THE DEAF AND THE BLIND IS UNDER SPECIAL EDUCATION. BECAUSE OF THAT RESTRICTION, THE ONLY DEAF CHILDREN WHO QUALIFY FOR ATTENDING USDB ARE THOSE WHO WOULD QUALIFY FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION...</p>
			<p>Does the Deaf Community understand what this means?? This means that the deaf children who attend USDB must have delays in some area and need remedial help. This means the intelligent deaf children, on grade level or above, CAN NOT attend USDB. If they do attend USDB, they either are mainstreamed as much as possible or receive a remedial education with the rest of the remedial students. (‘Remedial’ means “a special course to help students overcome deficiencies.”)</p>
			<p>The only way for deaf children to be educated together and for the possibility for a Day school is to CHANGE THE LAW. We need the Deaf Community’s political clout to accomplish this. Please help! You accomplished so much last legislative session. You need to do it again.</p>
			<p>Sincerely,<br> O’Hara, Parent</p>
			<p>(O’Hara, UAD Bulletin, January 1995, p. 3).</p>

		<p>Bronwyn discovered this fact during one of her daughter, Ellen’s IEP meetings in the Fall of 1994. It added to a piece of information she’d gotten a few years earlier during a phone conversation with Steve Kukic, the State Director of Special Education. He told her that all deaf children started out under his Department of Special Education, not under regular education. Because of that, there were specific rules to be followed.</p>
		<p>At the beginning of that fateful 1994 IEP meeting, Bronwyn had requested that Ellen have direct access to teachers and student peers without having an interpreter as a go-between. She explained to Steve Noyce, their Outreach Program Director, that Ellen needed adults who were deaf to be behavior and language models. Further, Ellen needed peers who were close to her own skills in communication and language. However, Noyce reported that the law did not allow grade-level or above grade-level deaf students to be educated in an USDB classroom. He explained that because of the designation of Special Education for all deaf students, Ellen’s educational placement could only take the remedial route if she stayed at USDB. Bronwyn was stunned. She asked where the intelligent deaf students went. He answered with one word: 'Mainstreamed' (Bronwyn O’Hara, personal communication, August 27, 2009).</p>
		<p>At about that same time some states were putting their gifted students under the Special Education umbrella so they could fund their gifted programs easier. With this in mind and to counter the Utah law, Bronwyn asked Noyce to create an IEP with a gifted student's goals for Ellen so she could get an education on or above grade-level at USDB. He just shook his head and said it wouldn’t happen in Utah. He said the law would have to be changed in order for the situation to change (Bronwyn O’Hara, personal communication, August 27, 2009).</p>
		<p>After this illuminating IEP meeting, Bronwyn felt the Deaf Community needed to know what was going on; to know what was holding up the progress of better deaf education. She sent her article to the UAD Bulletin so they could know and plan how to change the law (Bronwyn O’Hara, personal communication, August 27, 2009).</p>
		<p>At the same time Bronwyn was battling with USD, she developed a friendship with Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz, a third-generation deaf woman. Minnie Mae helped educate her regarding deaf education issues. From 1987 to 1995 when the O’Hara’s were in Utah, Minnie Mae gave her many academic journal articles regarding language learning, story-telling, and deaf education. Each were conscientiously copied and given to Steve Noyce as well so he could be 'on the cutting edge' of current deaf educational philosophy and strategies. It was hoped that he would incorporate those teaching strategies into what is called “best practices” in deaf education circles. Steve had those materials all those years (Bronwyn O’Hara, personal communication, August 27, 2009).</p>
		<p>Minnie Mae explained that deaf children need deaf adult role models and deaf peers. She helped Bronwyn see that deaf children were held back by delays in acquiring language, not by their mental IQs. Minnie Mae’s personal view that teachers of the deaf do not need a Special Education endorsement on their teaching certificate in order to teach deaf children influenced Bronwyn as well. It made sense. Why would deaf students need special (remedial) education when these students were just like any other student who needed regular educational curricula, the kind that any hearing child would receive (Bronwyn O’Hara, personal communication, August 27, 2009)?</p>
		<p>Bronwyn credited Utah Association for the Deaf for sending her with a deaf group to two deaf educational conferences on their behalf: one at the California School for the Deaf in Fremont, California and one in Omaha, Nebraska. When she reported back to them, she was surprised they didn't want an actual presentation. UAD took her written report and she never heard anything more from them. If that report was to be used for formulating a 'battle plan', Bronwyn didn’t know about it. Maybe the UAD remembered the 1992 USDB Institutional Council meeting where it went on record to endorse “that students need to be mainstreamed to the maximum when possible” in spite of Dr. Robert G. Sanderson (Sanderson, UAD Bulletin, March 1992)’s opposition to that. Maybe the UAD knew there was more preparation needed before tackling this issue (Bronwyn O’Hara, personal communication, August 27, 2009).</p>
		<p>Over the course of the eight years Bronwyn and her family were in Utah, she felt there were so many educational policies that were never discussed with or explained to parents. Further, she felt that every single piece of information she found out was dug out through her own reading/phone calling and by asking questions at her children’s IEP meetings. USD didn’t seem used to explaining these details. Either they had never been questioned by parents before or they had taken on a mythical role of being ‘all-knowing’ in the parents’ eyes. Administrators were surprised by Bronwyn’s desire for more detail. She kept asking questions that no one had ever asked before (Bronwyn O’Hara, personal communication, August 27, 2009).</p>
		<p>For example, after the first year or two in the USD system, there was an IEP that Bronwyn hadn’t signed. She believed the law when it said if there was a disagreement with the plan, a parent didn’t have to sign. In his attempt to get her signature, Steve Noyce urgently told her that compliance officers would be coming to inspect all the paperwork and the school would get in trouble if everything wasn't filled out correctly. She signed, thinking the compliance officers would help her make sure the program was good for her daughter. However, a year afterwards, she asked Steve why didn't the compliance officers look over the IEP and see that goals weren’t being achieved and that the program wasn't working for her child. Why didn't they assure the quality of the programs the children were in? Noyce simply answered that all they looked for were the signatures on the forms in the right places. They were not checking the quality of the program nor were they evaluating any part of the IEP goals as appropriate or inappropriate for the students (Bronwyn O’Hara, personal communication, August 27, 2009).</p>
	<p>To Bronwyn, that was another 'knock in the head' epiphany. She felt the earlier 'urgency to sign' was a manipulation so Steve could get the formalities done. He had complained before to the other Program Directors how he had to put up with her resistance to sign when she disagreed with aspects of her daughter’s IEP. She felt it was a ploy he’d devised to get her to sign (Bronwyn O’Hara, personal communication, August 27, 2009).</p>
		<p>Bronwyn began to think that Noyce was following what Dr. Lee Robinson had told her when he was Superintendent. He said "I won't lie to you, Bronwyn, but I won't necessarily tell you everything." Interesting how that was an echo of what Skip Reese, Director of Parent Infant Program when the O’Hara’s moved to Utah in 1987, told her. She said that she would answer every question a parent had. The problem was: the parents had to come up with the questions. There were so many things they didn't even know to ask. And when Bronwyn complained about the lack of signing PIP advisors and how services did not meet the language needs of her daughter, Skip deflated her by saying, “Oh, it’s a lot better than it used to be.” and left it at that (Bronwyn O’Hara, personal communication, August 27, 2009).</p>
		<p>It was time to peel away the cloak of “omniscience” from USDB. They didn’t have all the answers. They didn’t use the information they had been given or used so little of it that there was no real improvement to their programs for deaf students. They were not on the cutting edge of educational philosophies and strategies in deaf education. Their traditional approach to teaching the deaf had to be knocked off its pedestal (Bronwyn O’Hara, personal communication, August 27, 2009).</p>
		<p>Just as the TV show "The People's Court" (1981-1993) with Judge Wapner de-mythed how legal proceedings were carried out and helped the general public not be intimidated by going to court or being taken to court, Bronwyn shared the concept of ’de-mything' USD (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People's_Court). As this TV show took the mystery out of the court room experience so people could understand the process better and prepare themselves better in the event of a legal situation, Bronwyn wanted to help other parents of deaf children not be intimidated by the school's team of professionals and the IEP process. She did this by founding the Support Group for Deaf Education, holding parent meetings, inviting guest speakers, creating a monthly newsletter, and writing letters to the editor to the UAD Bulletin and the Utah Parent Center newsletter.</p>
		<p>When it became clear that the law needed changing, the O’Hara’s decided to move out of Utah. Bronwyn didn’t want her deaf child(ren) mainstreamed and cut off educationally and socially from deaf adults and peers. Her child had an interpreter in 4th grade that was absolutely horrible and there was no recourse to get a better one. Situations like this compromised her child’s education. These years could not be recaptured. It was time to find a school that had the right philosophy in place. The O’Hara’s moved to Indianapolis, Indiana where Ellen attended the Indiana School for the Deaf. They had a Bilingual-Bicultural philosophy as the backbone of their academic program (Bronwyn O’Hara, personal communication, August 27, 2009).</p>
		<h3>Taking on the System: A Parent’s Perspective—Take 2</h3>
		<p>Twelve years later in 2007, it was another parent’s turn to learn the system. Jodi B. Kinner was a deaf parent of deaf children (She moved to Utah from Washington, D.C. in the year of 2000 and wasn’t aware of Bronwyn’s situation until later). She was also a member of USDB’s Institutional Council representing the Deaf community. Her two deaf children, Joshua and Danielle attended Jean Massieu School. This school began as a public charter day school for the deaf where American Sign Language was the language of instruction. In 2005 it was merged with USD and became USD’s signing option for students (Jean Massieu and Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind Terms of Agreements, 2005).</p>
		<p>When Jodi’s son, Joshua turned 3 in 2004, he was easily enrolled at JMS as a public independent charter school without the fuss having to go through the school district. After the 2005 merger, JMS under the USD’s wing was required to comply with the IDEA regulations by referring the families to their local school district before an initial placement was made. When the decision was made to place Danielle who just turned 3 in 2006 at JMS, she however had to go through the proper procedures mandated by IDEA and took an evaluation tests. During the IEP meeting, it was reported that Danielle was 6 months behind academically and thus, she was eligible for the JMS services. Jodi became confused and asked the IEP Team if Danielle were academically on-par would she be qualified for JMS. The answer was no. The more she asked questions, the more vague answers were given. She let it go until one year later in 2007 when the Joshua’s annual evaluation report arrived. The result of his test score was 84. At the IEP meeting, Jodi was alarmed to learn that he was one point shy of being mainstreamed! For decades, when deaf, blind and deaf-blind students scored 85 or higher, they were “kicked out” of the USDB and transferred into a mainstreaming setting.</p>
		<p>The more Jodi, as a Gallaudet Social Work graduate with an emphasis in education, particularly law and policy learned about the Utah Code that regulated the USDB, she was blown away to discover that Utah Code 53A-25-104, part of the Legislative code establishing and defining Utah School for the Deaf, states, in part, that hearing-impaired children need to be found eligible for special education before an Individualized Education Plan could be written [Code 53A-25-104(2) (a) and (b)]. Yet, in its definition of the Utah School for the Deaf, the law says USD can educate all deaf and hearing-impaired children in the state. These two laws seemed to contradict each other. Utah Code 25A-25-103 said USDB was able to educate all deaf children, and then UC 53A-25-104 said the children had to be eligible for special education in order to get services from USDB (Utah State Legislature: Utah Code 53A-25-104).</p>
		<p>Because the law forced USD to view its deaf and hard of hearing students under the Special Education umbrella, it created havoc when there were no IEP goals to write. If, for example, a student was not below grade-level in math, then there could be no math goals written. This translated into the student not even qualifying for an IEP. That student would be “kicked out” of USD where the deaf adult role models and peers are. He/she would be transferred into hearing mainstream programs. Because there was no deficit in the student’s learning, he/she was no longer considered eligible for special education, hence no IEP. An IEP was a necessary element in Special Education. It was a legal instrument that allows for state core educational curriculum to be modified from accepted state standards. Since USDB fell under Special Education, services were only to be given to those with special needs and delays. These students would qualify for the development of an IEP. The fact that a potential student would have to qualify for special education meant that, not only would each child have to have a hearing loss, he or she would also have to have some sort of academic delay in order to attend USD. If a deaf student was on or above grade-level that deaf child would be deemed ineligible and could not attend any of the USD classrooms.</p>
		<p>Minnie Mae was aware of the law, but this fact did not hit home for her until 2007 during her oldest deaf daughter, Briella’s IEP meeting. She was told that her daughter may not be eligible for services at the Jean Massieu School. This was a shock. Because of the merger with USD two years prior, this law impacted JMS as well as USD. Where JMS had provided services for all deaf and hard-of-hearing students since its founding, the merger put JMS under USDB and therefore under the State Special Education Department and its rules (Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz, personal communication, August 11, 2009).</p>
		<p>Jodi was extremely upset by this law, and she was not willing to let this law affect her children as well as other children’s education. She did her research and her resultant facts concerning the Utah Code 53A-25-104 were presented to the Institutional Council on May 23, 2007 (Institutional Council Minutes, May 23, 2007). She detailed how Utah Code -103 required that students have a hearing loss in order to attend USDB while Utah Code -104 dealt with special needs and academic delays. She clearly showed these two laws were in conflict. She used her deaf children’s situations as examples in her presentation to explain the impact and inconsistencies of these two Codes. Jodi asked the Institutional Council to support an effort to get Code 53A-25-104 amended to fit current Deaf Education trends and to lift the restrictions. The law should make it clear that USD is able to serve both delayed and non-delayed deaf or hearing-impaired students as stated in Utah Code 25A-25-103. Students with academic delays could have their educational needs met by writing into their IEPs what special services they would require. Those students who were above or on-grade level could utilize federal law Section 504 to provide for their educational services. Section 504 provides for accommodations. In this application it would be in the form of direct communication and instruction. Using the laws in this way, USD would be able to provide services to any deaf or hard of hearing student in the state who attended their programs (Jodi B. Kinner, personal communication, April 14, 2007).</p>
		<p>Utah Code 53A-25-104 was found to be the culprit as more and more students were not being educated at USD. It is possible that this code was the # 1 barrier to improving the quality of education for deaf and hard of hearing students in the state. The consequences of which, over the years, was a loss of most of the academically advanced students to mainstreaming or to moving out-of-state. Under this law, USD was not able to serve the academically advanced students who are deaf and hard of hearing. Instead it was relegated to only serving the academically delayed students and students with multiple disabilities who were also deaf. Looking at this situation from the big picture, this would not cause the school to progress or to keep up with educational trends. The fact that this code interfered with USD’s ability to serve the deaf and hard of hearing student population was in direct contradiction to the reauthorized Individuals with Disabilities Act of 1997 (Jodi B. Kinner, personal communication, April 14, 2007). Seaver (2006) stated, “When IDEA was re-authorized in 1997, it included, for the first time, specific language that knowledge the need for special considerations when the student was deaf or hard of hearing.” In addition, when IDEA was re-authorized in 2004, the full continuum of alternative placements was required in order to meet the deaf child’s communication needs, linguistic needs, and social, personal and cultural needs (CEASD’s Position Paper on the Full Continuum of Educational Placements for All Students who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing, 2007).</p>
		<p>On the other side of the coin, teachers shared the frustration. Teachers trained in special education view their students as disabled and delayed in some way and design their courses to meet the needs of that type of students. Even though these teachers encouraged their students to do their best, there were very low scholastic expectations for them. However, when these highly trained special education teachers were presented with students who were deaf but not delayed, they were not prepared to deal with them. In contrast, teachers who are trained in Deaf education view their deaf and hard of hearing students as regular students who happen to be deaf and may have delays, for example, due to lack of communication at home. Their courses are designed to encourage students to strive for academic excellence. Dr. Robert G. Sanderson shared his perspective that special needs children should not be mixed in a classroom with normal deaf children who present problems of their own in learning (Sanderson, Ogden Standard-Examiner, May 13, 2001). Needless to say, there can be a great benefit to pairing up deaf students with teachers who have Deaf Education degrees rather than Special Education degrees in this kind of learning environment (Jodi B. Kinner, personal communication, April 14, 2007; Bronwyn O’Hara, personal communication, August 27, 2009).</p>
		<p>Teachers who were trained and certified in the field of Deaf Education were not able to maximize their own teaching potential because of the loss of academically advanced students to local school districts. Instead they had to deal with Special Education students and this created an overall sub-par education for deaf students at USD. There were too many students with multiple disabilities mixed into the “normal” classrooms. Often the teachers became full time caregivers, not teachers and one-on-one attention one student received was held back all of the others, even with a full time teacher’s aide (Sanderson, Ogden Standard-Examiner, May 13, 2001).</p>
		<p>Some students, who were academically on-par and transferred into a mainstreaming program, still received a sub-par education. The quality of education was compromised because there was a terrible lack of qualified educational interpreters. Without access to the teacher, student-peers, and informational knowledge, the deaf students were left with an inability to access their education. Add to that, the even more difficult situation of the signing students who were mainstreamed into inadequate classroom settings. They were left with no access to a visual language or visual teaching methods. While these students were often placed in their local neighborhood schools near their homes, most of the time there were no other deaf students with which to associate. This created an overwhelming feeling of isolation. Sometimes these students would be placed in self-contained classrooms with other deaf students. Students in these classrooms frequently experienced frustration and segregation through inappropriate groupings of students with vastly different ages, language abilities, and academic skills (Jodi B. Kinner, personal communication, April 14, 2007).</p>
		<p>Even if students who were on-or above grade level wanted to transfer back to a USD classroom or program, there’d be no academic peers because these students had been transferred out per policy and law. Hence the cycle would go on and on in a downward spiral of frustration – a true “Catch-22” (Jodi Becker Kinner, personal communication, April 14, 2007; Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz, personal communication, 2007).</p>
		<p>With its emphasis on special education, Code 53A-25-104 actually added a barrier to promoting quality education at USDB/JMS. This barrier made USDB focus on the placement process only without developing effective communication and language-driven educational goals for the students. With this law in the way, it was impossible to improve the quality of deaf education in regard to teaching viable information in the classrooms. There was no way to address language and communication needs (Siegel, 2007; Jodi B. Kinner, personal communication, April 14, 2007).</p>
		<p>This Utah Code impacted all three programs at USD: Oral, Total Communication, and ASL/English Bilingual Education.</p>
		<p>Many oral deaf students were also not able to receive the full, language-rich environment they needed for their educational potential because of the emphasis on remedial courses. This seemed odd given the communication goals the Central Institute for the Deaf had set up for their deaf students. This school, founded in St. Louis in 1914, was/is at the forefront of using auditory-oral strategies to convey educational information to their deaf. They serve as a model for other oral programs around the country. Their communication goals are: “We foster literacy for every child. It begins with our dynamic, uncompromising New Auditory-Oral Preschool program that incorporates mainstream educational methods designed to help deaf children develop emerging literacy and pre-academic skills in a print-and language-rich environment” (http://cid.edu/images/deafeducation/Literacy.htm; (Jodi Becker Kinner, personal communication, April 14, 2007).</p>
		<p>The Total Communication program was negatively affected as well for those students in that program. Their overall achievement goals were waylaid because of the difficulty in being educated in an environment with academic peers. A point of interest is that most of the deaf and hearing-impaired children who had additional disabilities were encouraged to enroll in the USD Total Communication program (Jodi Becker Kinner, personal communication, April 14, 2007). Students in self-contained classrooms frequently experience isolation through inappropriate grouping of students with vastly different language abilities, academic skills, and ages (Siegel, 2000).</p>
		<p>As for JMS, its ASL/English bilingual program was designed for deaf and hard of hearing students with normal to high cognitive and academic abilities. Most of the teachers who taught at JMS had/have Deaf Education degrees. According to the JMS’ Mission Statement, their goals aimed to provide high quality education with direct communication/instruction and total immersion in language and communication (JMS Mission Statement, 1999). However, because of this law, it was not allowed to serve students who didn’t qualify for special education. JMS was slowly losing students as a result and its academic expectations were starting to deteriorate. A few families had transferred their children to local school districts and others had transferred them out of state where they might receive a better education among a greater number of peers. The cycle that had its hold on the Oral and Total Communication programs was starting to repeat itself at JMS (Jodi B. Kinner, personal communication, April 14, 2007).</p>
		<p>It is possible that Dr. Grant B. Bitter played a big role in creating this restricting Code in the late 1970s, after the federal government’s Public Law 94-142 passed on Nov 29, 1975. The goal of PL 94-142 was mainstreaming special needs children and this Utah Code was designed to push it along.</p>
		<p>An example of his possible involvement is shown in the following account. Dr. Grant B. Bitter reported to the Utah State Board of Education on August 19, 1977 that emerging trends in implementing Public Law 94-142 influenced the Michigan State Board of Education to set up a Study Committee. This committee evaluated the educational programs at the Michigan School for the Deaf and Michigan School for the Blind. The major recommendations were to:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Establish an Admissions and Discharge Committee to determine the eligibility and needs of children to enter MSD and MSB. </li>
			<li>Phase out academic programming for normal deaf children to programs for hearing impaired and visually impaired at the local level. </li>
			<li>Serve primarily multiply-handicapped deaf at MSD and multiply-handicapped blind students at MSB. </li>
			<li>Develop outreach services to aid local programs to serve deaf children and blind children. (Bitter, 1977, p. 6 ) </li>
		</ol>
		<p>Apparently, Dr. Bitter liked the recommendations from Michigan’s Study Committee because he successfully changed the role of the Utah School for the Deaf to mirror what Michigan had done. Whereas prior, the school was able to serve all deaf and hearing-impaired students of the state, Utah Code 53A-25-104 was created to limit or eliminate serving deaf students who were grade-appropriate. Because of this change the number of students eligible to be served legally by USD/JMS was severely restricted.</p>
		<p>There were flaws in the law. The updated IDEA superseded Code 53A–25–104 and yet, USD and Utah school districts were still complying with the older code. There was not adequate consideration of language and communication needs/modes nor adequate critical mass at most of USD’s programs and classrooms; USD did not provide a full continuum of options; most of USD’s students continued to be mainstreamed; and LRE was not viewed as Language Rich Environment. With these results, it may be argued that the traditional “LRE” for a deaf and hard of hearing student may be the most restrictive environment (Seaver & DesGeorges, Hands & Voices PowerPoint, 2007). All this hurt USD’s ability to provide quality education, full language and communication accessibility and critical mass. In other words, the current system was not effectively addressing these needs.</p>
		<h3>Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind Legislative Workgroup</h3>
		<p>During the administration of Superintendent Linda Rutledge, parents attempted to enroll their non-verbal hearing down-syndrome son who communicated in American Sign Language at Jean Massieu School, under the wing of Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind, but he was disqualified because he did not have sensory impairment – deaf. The family therefore, went through the legislative process in 2007. However, the House Bill 291 that governed USDB would not allow that. It was proposed that would have broadened the scope of USDB to include services to students with disabilities who are not blind/visually impaired, deaf/hard of hearing, or deafblind.</p>
		<p>The deaf and blind representatives who served on the Institutional Council spoke against it. They urged that USDB needed to focus on the original intent of the school and to clarify its role by only serving deaf/hard of hearing, blind/visually impaired, and deafblind students and raise academic expectations. Accepting more students with additional disabilities could water-down the USDB program.</p>
		<p>Although the bill did not pass in the legislature, a number of concerned legislators expressed a desire to have the statute reviewed to consider possible amendments. On August 17, 2007, the Utah State Office of Education formed the USDB Legislative Workgroup, made up stakeholders and legislators and had meeting almost every month until June 1, 2008. Two deaf representatives of the Institutional Council, Dennis Platt and Jodi B. Kinner were assigned to serve on this workgroup.</p>
		<p>The purpose of the workgroup was to update the Utah Code that regulated the USDB. The original goal was to introduce the final draft of the Utah Code to the Legislative session in January 2008. However, it was felt that extra time to study and consider other state models by Utah State Office of Education, Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind, USDB Institutional Council, and USBD Legislative Workgroup was needed to help improve the USDB program. It was agreed to postpone to January 2009.</p>
		<p>The areas the workgroup addressed were:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Administrative structure of USDB</li>
			<li>USDB student eligibility and admission</li>
			<li>Role of Utah State Board of Education</li>
			<li>Role of USDB Institutional Council</li>
			<li>Relationship between USDB and Local School Districts</li>
			<li>Services provided by USDB</li>
			<li>Funding mechanism for USDB</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Eligibility, Structure and Placement were the primary concerns among the workgroup and hot topic to discuss as well.</p>
		<h3>Utah State Board of Education</h3>
		<p>Similar to Dr. Jay J. Campbell’s role in 1960s and 1970s, Karl Wilson, as a Director of Title 1 at the Utah State Office of Education, was assigned to supervise the Utah School for the Deaf. On October 5th, 2007, Wilson updated the Utah State Board of Education regarding the USD and the Blind Legislative Workgroup. He mentioned that during the 2007 Legislative session, questions were raised concerning statutory language and the need to update the law to meet with current special education rules (Memorandum, October 5, 2007).</p>
		<p>Parents of deaf children and Deaf community were dumbfounded to learn the impact of Utah Code 53A-25-104 on USDB and spoke against it. Utah Deaf Education and Literacy, Inc who was responsible for USDB/JMS merger was unaware of the eligibility requirement.</p>
		<p>Between September 18 and October 2, 2007 Dr. Patti Harrington, State Superintendent of Public Instruction received correspondence from 30 parents and community members with comments regarding the work of the USDB Legislative Workgroup. Two letters were sent from individuals representing the blind/visually impaired and 28 letters from individuals representing deaf/hard of hearing (Utah State Board of Education: USDB Legislative Workgroup Report, October 5, 2007). Four Deaf individuals, Dan Mathis, a grandson of USD Alumni, Jack and Vida White, Jeff Pollock, Coordinator of Deaf Services/Advisor, Julio Diaz, a husband of JMS co-founder, Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz and Jodi B. Kinner, a deaf representative of USDB Institutional Council were present in the meeting. Dan and Jeff spoke to the board concerning the Utah Code. Dan stated, “He was not impressed with the programs in Utah. He had seen better programs throughout the United States for deaf children and their education. He agreed that he services needed to be improved and supported the proposed changes to the code other legislative processes that allow USDB to give parents better options and services to children who are deaf, blind, and deaf-blind.” (Utah State Board of Education minutes, October 5, 2007).</p>
		<p>Jeff commented that, “We can’t stop in changing the law. There were systematic problems throughout USD that affect deaf education in Utah. Deaf students were not being prepared for college” (Utah State Board of Education minutes, October 5, 2007).</p>
		<p>A large number supported amending the statue to lift the cap by allowing students who are at or above grade level to attend USDB, not just those who have an IEP. The correspondence had impact and it eventually caught legislators’ attention (Utah State Board of Education: USDB Legislative Workgroup Report, October 5, 2007).</p>
		<h3>A Group of Concerned Legislators</h3>
		<p>On February 6, 2008, a group of concerned legislators sent a letter to the Utah State Board of Education regarding the eligibility of students to be served by Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind. Representative Jennifer Seelig was one of the legislators who felt very strongly about the eligibility law and spoke against it. [PHOTO]</p>
		<p>For many years, any deaf, blind and deaf-blind students served by USDB who achieved academically on grade-level, were automatically moved out of the USDB (including JMS) system and were placed in a mainstream setting at their local school district where they no longer qualified for special education. However, during the transition of placement, the aspect of students’ social and communication needs were often overlooked and not always addressed in the mainstream setting. Thus, families moved out of the state where they could have their school placement choice (Kinner, UAD Bulletin, April 2008).</p>
		<p>On February 28, 2008, the Institutional Council’s voted unanimously to allow deaf, blind and deaf-blind students who achieve grade level standards to remain at USDB (Utah State Legislature Letter, 2008; Institutional Council Minutes, 2008; Kinner, UAD Bulletin, April 2008). APPENDIX</p>
		<p>Upon the Institutional Council’s approval, Dr. Patti Harrington, State Superintendent of Public Instruction responded to Utah State Legislature’s letter concerning USDB in the Utah State Board of Education meeting on March 7, 2008 (Memorandum, March 7, 2008). She requested that the Utah State Board of Education allow students who have achieved at or above grade-level to be continually served by USDB/JMS until the USDB Legislative Task Force develops language for a permanent solution to the Utah Code for the 2009 legislative session. This request had been granted (Kinner, UAD Bulletin, April 2008).</p>
		<h3>Recommendations from the Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind Legislative Workgroup</h3>
		<p>After months of legislative meeting, on May 28, 2008, the USDB Legislative Workgroup arrived at the following recommendations.</p>
		<p>Karl Wilson updated the USDB Legislative Workgroup’s recommendations to the Utah State Board of Education on June 13, 2008. The workgroup expressed general support for most issues. There was disagreement in terms of future organization of USDB and eligibility criteria for students to be served at USDB.</p>
		<p>The USDB Legislative Workgroup agreed and recommended that students who are deaf, blind, or deafblind in Utah be eligible for USDB services. Students qualifying for Special Education would have eligibility and placement decisions made through the IEP process. Also, students in need of accommodations under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 would have eligibility and placement decisions made through the 504 plan process.</p>
		<p>This change would allow students who are deaf, blind, or deafblind who are achieving at or above grade level to be eligible for services or placement with USDB if it is determined that it is in the best interest of the student (Utah State Board of Education USDB Legislative Workgroup Update, 2008).</p>
		<p>After sharing the recommendations with the board, Karl Wilson held seven public input meetings. Parents of deaf children and Deaf community met at the Sanderson Community Center of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing to give input on July 31, 2008.</p>
		<p>On August 8th, 2008, the subgroup, including Jodi Becker Kinner as a deaf representative of the USDB Legislative Workgroup met to determine if they were in support or opposed to specific points in the recommendations. They spent a great deal of effort to go through item by item. Some in public input felt it should change and others did not want change.</p>
		<p>Wilson then surveyed the Institutional Council members to determine if they were in support of or opposed to specific points in the recommendations. He met with Dr. Patti Harrington, Superintendent of Public Education to have that input. On September 12, 2008, Wilson met with the State Board of Education who will make the recommendation to the legislature during the 2009 legislative session. The key recommendations were: 1. Future administrative structure of USDB, 2. Eligibility and admissions to USDB, 3. Funding of USDB, and 4. Relationships between USDB and local education agencies (Memorandum, September 12, 2008).</p>
		<h3>A New Facility for Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind in the Salt Lake Area</h3>
		<p>Per interview for the Deseret News, Salt Lake Tribute and SignNews newspapers, Jodi B. Kinner, a parent of two deaf children who attended Jean Massieu School, shared the history the difficulties of Utah School for the Deaf requesting funds for a permanent school building.</p>
		<p>Every year for 10 years, the State of Utah had turned down Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind requests for a permanent building in the Salt Lake area. USDB wasn’t ranked high enough on the state building board’s list. It was felt that deaf and hard of hearing students had been marginalized. Their hearing loss appeared to make them less worthy citizens than other “normal” school students who had buildings and equipment and green space and mascots and identity.</p>
		<p>It was possible that USDB being viewed as an “agency” was another issue. Because of historical precedence, the State of Utah may not comprehend the needs of USDB having a school building when deaf students were mainstreamed in their local school districts. It was possible that lawmakers assumed that USDB needed just an office building without actual realizing that USDB/JMS did serve students on school campus. USDB faced double challenge because not only it was an educational organization, but it was also a state agency.</p>
		<p>Deaf and hard of hearing students did not have a permanent space where they can learn and function comfortably because Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind along with the majority of deaf schools were “agencies.” However, here in Utah, there were some possible pitfalls with having the statewide “authority” on deaf education considered an agency instead of a school. It means USDB was at greater risk for budget cuts (USDB is subject to the state budget for agencies), was not recognized as an academic institution in its own right, and its need for a school building with appropriate classrooms, gym and green space, etc., was also not recognized and/or appreciated.</p>
		<p>In fact, in addition to being an agency, USDB was also a state-wide school. Compared to the majority of states, state schools tend to be Center of education for the majority of deaf students in that state with relatively few students attending mainstreamed schools with support from their state school for the deaf. (Note that these state schools were also technically labeled as state agencies as was the case with USDB).</p>
		<p>However, because of the oral and mainstreaming philosophy at USD the reverse was the norm. USDB has traditionally focused on fulfilling its duties primarily as a state agency. Most of USD’s students were mainstreamed, often in self-contained classrooms managed by USD unlike in other states where mainstreamed students were usually managed by the school district in which the student went to school. In Utah, mainstreamed students managed by USD were counted separately from those who choose to be placed under the school districts rather than under USD.</p>
		<p>After Jean Massieu School, an ASL/English Bilingual program, merged with USD, the image of USD had changed. Under USD’s system, it was JMS’ goal to provide a school building for classes from pre-K through high school, including an athletic program, similar to what other state schools for the deaf provide. One way to correct the potential drawbacks of USD’s being an agency was to revisit the day school concept and view USD as primarily a statewide school serving deaf and hard of hearing students at a school campus.</p>
		<p>It was possible that the State of Utah primarily perceived USDB as an agency because of historical precedence. JMS has only (relatively) recently merged with USD and was now providing a day school program that provides direct instruction to students; however the day school concept did not seem to have caught on with everyone. This could be the reason USDB had not been successful in obtaining a permanent building for the growing student population at JMS.</p>
		<p>The federal law, the Amendments Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1997 and 2004, mandate a continuum of equal and appropriate education placement options, including special schools (deaf schools) for deaf and hard of hearing students with the options being effective communication and language-driven educational options for every deaf and hard of hearing child. Utah needed to work on developing this continuum, including supporting and building the day school that’s currently in place. Furthermore, Utah also needed a statewide residential school where students are treated equally, as in public schools.</p>
		<p>In 2000, Lawrence M. Siegel [hearing], a Special Education attorney pointed out that the role of special schools is important and emphasized that an equal placement option (meaning residential and/or day schools) should be designated by the state educational agency as a state’s “treasure resource” and be provided funds to ensure that each school district has direct access to them. Additionally, special schools would be available to provide expertise regarding communication/ language development, the importance of communication-proficient staff and critical mass, as well as serve as a model for a comprehensive and rich communication environment.</p>
		<p>In the past, deaf students attended a program operating out of a handful of neighborhood schools. The neighborhood school’s student population was increasing, the deaf program must give up its space and find a new location. In the eyes of the Deaf community, the deaf students were treated as “second class citizens.”</p>
		<p>For a long time, deaf and hard of hearing students in Utah had been relocated from facility to facility, in some cases annually. Others have been attending class in facilities with insufficient space or housed in run-down crumbling buildings or aging portables with no permanent home in sight. Instead of bouncing around, the students deserve an excellent education in a safe, stable learning environment where they can finally call home.</p>
		<p>As for JMS, the safety and health needs were deficient in their last facility. The heat or the air conditioning often went out, the water was down, the roof leaked, and carpet was unsafe. Additionally, the playground was inadequate with no grass.</p>
		<p>The most critical need was proper space, however with all of the unnecessary problems the students faced, their education was affected. For example, they couldn’t focus on education when the heat or air conditioning broke down. They were either freezing or hot. During the winter, they had to wear a coat and gloves in school.</p>
		<p>Because of the problems deaf students faced, the State of Utah needed to provide a better school space in order to give deaf students an option where they can learn and function comfortably (Fulton, Salt Lake Tribune, July 2008; Firkins, SignNews, September 2008).</p>
		<h3>Conner Street</h3>
		<p>In June 2008, Department of Facilities and Construction Management, Utah State Office of Education, the Governor’s Office, and the fiscal analyst had a meeting and decided that they need to make some decisions as soon as possible because Jean Massieu School will have to move out of its present location within the next few days. There was very little time for anything else. During the meeting, State Superintendent Patti Harrington called asking USDB Interim Superintendent Tim Smith, who assumed his position in 2007, if he could put the JMS students at the Conner location and put Related Services and Deaf Central staff in a business building. He accepted the offer.</p>
		<p>After three years of leasing the facility in South Jordan, Jean Massieu School moved into USDB’ s old administrative offices in Salt Lake City at another run down 55-years-old Grandview Elementary School building until the lease on that building expired at the end of 2009.</p>
		<h3>10 Talking Points for the Demonstration</h3>
		<p>Parents and advocates for Utah’s deaf students could no longer tolerate having poor school space and having state lawmakers showed no interest in doing anything about it. They was felt the lawmakers had ignored the problem long enough that they decided to start a rally for better treatment of deaf students at the Capitol hoping the lawmakers might finally funds for a permanent school building in Salt Lake County.</p>
		<p>While preparing for a rally on July 8th on Capitol Hill, Jodi Becker Kinner as a parent of deaf children along with two hearing parents, Gwyneth Kenner and Amy English developed 10 Talking Points and distributed flyers giving the history of USDB’s difficulties requesting state funding for a permanent building.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>USDB is both a state agency and a statewide school serving approximately 2000 students throughout Utah, about 400 of whom are served in self-contained classrooms by teachers specifically trained to work with deaf/hard of hearing, blind/visually impaired and deaf-blind children.</li>
			<li>For 10 years the State of Utah has turned down USDB permanent building requests.</li>
			<li>In the legislative session of ‘07 USDB was given a used five story office building to house our children and $500,000 for renovations with the assurance it was this or nothing. This was in place of approving a request for an actual school building.</li>
			<li>USDB made a good faith effort to make do, only to learn that a) renovations and bringing the building up to code for a school would cost 1.4 million for renovations to the first floor alone, and b) a school cannot be more than three stories. So, the building and the funds were taken away and not replaced.</li>
			<li>The building which housed USDB’s newly expanded ASL/English Bilingual students was due to be demolished this year leaving the school with nowhere to house those 72 day school students grades pre-k through 9th grade.</li>
			<li>USDB was offered an actual school building in the Salt Lake City school district. It turned out the building was riddled with asbestos and so far from code it would take over $1.5 million to renovate and then another $660,000/yr to lease. The State of Utah provided a mere $264,000 in one time lease moneys. The rest would need to come from cuts in direct services to students.</li>
			<li>The meetings and negotiations related to finding a building for USDB students have often taken place without inviting the administration of USDB.</li>
			<li>It is now the eleventh hour and the State of Utah has given up one more office building inappropriate for student use. With the start of school only about 45 days away, we question how the move and the renovation to create sufficient classroom space can possibly be accomplished. USDB will house these students in another run down school building on Connor St in Holladay, where the preschool for the Blind and a large number of staff presently reside. To make more space, USDB will move related services and administrators to the office building. Even so, the school on Connor St lacks sufficient space, is extremely run down, and has only one year left on the lease. After the Conner St lease expires in Spring 2009, where will these children get stuck next?</li>
			<li>As parents we feel our children have been marginalized, because their sensory impairments appear to make them less worthy citizens than other “normal” school children who have buildings and equipment and green space and mascots and identity. Groups of our children have been relocated from facility to facility, in some cases annually. Others have been housed in run down buildings or aging portables with no permanent home in sight. Our children deserve the same feeling of pride and identity as every other school child in Utah.</li>
			<li>Over the past few days there are whispers and rumors of a possible deal in the works; of perhaps change on the horizon. We don’t know if it’s the right thing. We don’t know if it’s all our children need. But, if this proves accurate, we applaud the efforts of those in government who are dedicated to serving all Utahns. As parents we want to believe that our children matter not only to ourselves, but to our schools, to our communities, and to our leaders. We are here to raise public awareness and to raise the awareness of those who are, in the end, our public servants. We ask the leaders of the State of Utah to please roll up your sleeves and truly serve the Utah children who are deaf, hard of hearing, blind, visually impaired and deaf/blind. Please support permanent facilities in Salt Lake and Utah Valleys for the Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind! APPENDIX </li>

		<h3>July 8th Rally on Capitol Hill</h3>
		<p>On July 8, 2008, appropriately 100 people were in attendance at the Capitol to rally for a permanent school building. Dozen of protesters picketed the capital steps to get funding for a permanent school building (Gonzales, KSL.com, July 8, 2008; Fulton, Salt Lake Tribune, July 8, 2008; Ziegler, KSL. com, July 8, 2008). The group of parents and students held signs reading “No Child Left Behind, unless you are Deaf and Blind,” and “Crumbling Classrooms are not Acceptable,” and “School Building Now.”</p>
		<p>One legislator, Representative Christine Johnson attended and talked with some of the rally participants. She said in the news that her lawmakers have ignored the problem long enough. She was hoping that this year will be different. She also hoped that these parents and teachers and the advocates being more vocal, more visible, will make it harder to deny their legitimate request (Gonzalez, KSL.com July 8, 2008).</p>
		<p>Television and radio stations were present. The parents and older deaf students spoke up. During the interview on the news, a 12-year-old JMS student, Maggie Flavin stated that,” It’s just unfair, we need a new school for our students. That way we can communicate with each other. If I was the only deaf student among hearing students, I wouldn’t have anyone to talk to, I would be isolated, I wouldn’t be able to learn and communicate” (Ziegler, KSL.com, July 8, 2008).</p>
		<p>A hearing mother, Jennifer Jackson of a 12-year-old JMS student participated in the interview by stating, “The alternative, mainstreaming the students, is not a satisfactory option.” She emphasized that, “They [JMS students] gain a sense of strength being together, as the deaf student body. Mainstreaming, I know for one, my son, he would go downhill fast if he were to be mainstreamed. He takes a sense of pride – he is deaf and proud of it – and he wants to be with his deaf peers” (Ziegler, KSL.com, July 8, 2008).</p>
		<p>It was their goal that their voices were heard and legislators will move USDB in the Salt Lake area to the top of the list when prioritizing funding for construction projects during the 2009 legislative session. The construction of a stand-alone school, would serve 350-450 deaf students throughout the Salt Lake Valley, had failed to receive funding for several years (Gonzalez, KSL.com, July 8, 2008).</p>
		<p>After the rally, Jodi B. Kinner along with other [hearing] parents had the opportunity to meet with Governor Jon M. Huntsman, Jr. and two of his cabinet members as well as a representative from Department of Facilities and Construction Management (responsible for finding buildings for governmental agencies). As Jodi walked into Governor Huntsman’s office, she was amazed to see the legendary American inventor, Thomas Alva Edison’s original light blubs being hung. (He was deafened from scarlet fever at age 14). During the meeting, they had a good conversation. They were shared some plans still in the works, which sound encouraging for the future.</p>
		<p>A group of concerned people hoped with Governor Huntsman’s support, the lawmakers would finally provide funds for a new permanent facility in order to meet the educational, safety and health needs of our students, including the playground space and a full sized gym during the legislative session.</p>
		<h3>Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind Won Funding Support</h3>
		<p>On August 19, 2008, Dr. Patti Harrington, State Superintendent of Public Instruction wrote a letter to Ron Bigelow, Utah House of Representative suggesting specialized consideration for USDB, like any other state agency when it comes to facilities through the Department of Facilities and Construction Management ranking process, the needs of USDB in behalf of their students were very unique and somewhat complex (Utah State Office of Education, 2008).</p>
		<p>Timothy W. Smith, Superintendent of USDB made a presentation to the State Board of Education on September 13, 2008. He asked the board’s help in the school’s long quest to find a permanent home. The board unanimously voted to publicly support Superintendent Smith’s proposal state funding for a permanent building to lawmakers. Top leadership in the legislature had given DFCM their support in the proposal as well (Fulton, Salt Lake Tribune, September 13, 2008).</p>
		<p>It was hoped to purchase and retrofit the Libby Edwards Elementary school at 1655 E. 3300 South in the Granite School District in order to place students from its Jean Massieu School in the fall of 2009.</p>
		<p>During the 2008 legislative session, Superintendent Smith requested $14.9 million from state lawmakers for a school of its own, but was turned down. He told the board that,” If the school doesn’t get an amount significantly less than last year’s request during the next legislative session, circumstance will worsen.” He also said, “If the Legislature refuses what we’re proposing, to be honest, I don’t know what we’re going to do,” Smith said. “We believe this is the best proposal we have” (Fulton, Salt Lake Tribune, September 13, 2008).</p>
		<p>Because the USDB was considered both a state agency and a school, it cannot bond and collect money similar to other schools. USDB must go to lawmakers every year to explain its needs and request money (Fulton, Salt Lake Tribune, September 13, 2008).</p>
		<p>It was still hope to be ranked #1 on the priority list for the Building Committee. The process was long and sometimes rocky. USDB was one step closer to the realization of their goal.</p>
		<h3>Senate Bill 201 Passes</h3>
		<p>Finally, Senate Bill 201 was passed for the issuance of bonds to buy Libby Edwards and the property for USDB on 1655 E. 3300 South.</p>
		<p>It was quite a scare because after the rally took place at the Capitol in July 2008, Superintendent Smith gave his presentation at the Utah State Board of Education in August and again for the State Building Board in October, USDB was ranked #1 out of 27 proposal and remained that way until February. During the 2009 Legislature session, the legislators had re-shuffled the list and USDB was dropped on priority list to #5. Division of Facilities Construction & Management assured USDB not to worry and said that they were doing a political move called more gainsmanship. As the legislation session drew near, DFCM ranked USDB back to #1 and Governor Huntsman signed the Senate Bill 201 on March 23, 2009!</p>

	<h3>House Bill 296 Passes</h3>
		<p>On February 17, 2009 Jodi B. Kinner testified in front of the House Education Committee in full support of the House Bill 296. It passed unanimously out of the House Education Committee. Afterwards, it went to the House of Representative floor and then to the Senate floor. In fact all the Senators  spoke really kind things about USDB and how supportive they were of USDB.</p>
		<p>The Utah Legislators passed HB 296 that regulates Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind. The House passed it 68-0 on February 18, 2009 and the Senate passed HB 296 27-0 on March 18. The bill alleviates concerns about, and provides solutions for, major issues such as administration structure, placement and eligibility that USDB faced at that time.</p>
		<p>A major break-through occurred on March 25, 2009 when HB 296 was signed into law by Governor Jon Huntsman, Jr. after passing unanimously though both Houses of the State Legislature. The new law stated that deaf and hard-of-hearing students could be educated together and at USD/JMS regardless of their educational level. Money and effort could be put towards improving their education to reflect grade-appropriate curricula. While it will take time to get the students up to those expectations and standards, a new era in Utah Deaf Education has truly begun.</p>
		<p>The portion on eligibility was able to help raise academic expectations by providing students full access to core curriculum and lift school placement restrictions by focusing on communication and language-driven educational options. In addition, this bill assured that USDB was the appropriate educational placement for services in Utah where it will allow USDB to become available to provide expertise regarding language and communication development as well as to provide a rich communication environment in a new school building in the Salt Lake area.</p>
		<p>With this new bill, USDB deaf, blind and deaf-blind students will be given options:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Individualized Education Plan (Establish academic/services goals for those students who are not on-level) or</li>
			<li>Section 504 (Those who are on-level need direct communication and instruction with teachers and peers in ASL).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>As quoted below requesting that students who are deaf or hard of hearing have IEP or Section 504 options in the new law with the USDB Institutional Council and USDB Legislative Task Force, they supported this requested.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>"Code 53A-25-104 needs to be amended to fit current Deaf Education trends and to lift the restrictions. USDB should serve both delayed and non-delayed students as stated in 25A-25-103. This can be done by having IEPs written for those with a delay, and utilizing Section 504 for services provided to students who are on-level. This indicates that the students still need accommodations in the form of direct communication and instruction. This way, USDB can provide services to any deaf or hard-of-hearing student (Kinner, 2007).”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>If it was not for the 28 letters from parents and the ASL community to Dr. Patti Harrington, State Superintendent of Public Instruction as well as not for Dan Mathis and Jeff Pollock speaking to the Utah State Board of Education concerning the Utah Code in October 2007, the portion of eligibility would not have happened. A large number supported amending the statue to lift the cap by allowing students who are at or above grade level to attend USDB/JMS, not just those who have an IEP. The correspondence had impact and it eventually caught legislators’ attention.</p>
		<h3>USDB Bill Signing</h3>
		<p>On April 30th, 2009, Governor Jon Huntsman, Jr. held a ceremonial signing of HB 296 in the Gold Room located on the 2nd floor, southwest corner of the Capitol. Jodi Kinner, Jill & Craig Radford, Joe & Debbie Zeidner and their daughter Jessi, Michelle Tanner, Jan Ferre, Leslie & Dero Gertsch, Von Hortin, Joseph & Melanie Minor and their son Ken. Larry Shumway (USOE), Gregg Buxton (DCFS), Melanie Austin (USDB) were present. Rep Kenneth Sumsion and Rep Jennifer Seelig who sponsored the HB 296 were also there.</p>

			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>Parker Holt, Tres Diaz, and Isicc Prettypaint, JMS sixth graders, won first place at the National RIT Science Fair. They were the first team from Utah ever to be picked to make a presentation. They were up against top Deaf schools in the nation. Top scientific minds from New York and Los Angles met at the National RIT Science Fair in Rochester, New York to present their projects on topics. The boy’s project was entitled, “Safety Signs.” It measured the safety of signing and driving at the same time by comparing it to a lone driver not communicating at the same time. Their research discovered that the fact many Deaf drivers need to make direct eye contact while communicating, and driving in this way can lead to a greater risk of accidents. One of the judges was blown away by the clarity of their scientific process (UAD Bulletin, April 2009).</p>

		<h3>Ribbon Cutting Ceremony</h3>
		<p>In January of 2010, JMS and other students from different programs moved into the Salt Lake City Campus on 1655 East 3300 South where they can finally call it home.</p>
		<p>A grand opening with a ribbon-cutting ceremony took place at the new Salt Lake City Campus on March 15, 2010. Superintendent Steven W. Noyce and Jill Radford, JMS Principal gave their speeches across the main entrance of the school building. Superintendent Noyce, then cut the ribbon in a ritualistic manner declaring the building open for school. All JMS teachers and students were present along with some USOE and USDB employers to witness such event. So were three Deaf adults: Valerie Kinney (UAD member), Minnie-Mae Wilding-Diaz (parent), and Jodi Becker Kinner (parent).</p>
		<p>After the speeches were given, Dr. Jennifer Howell, Associate Superintendent hosted touring around the school campus. It was quite a victory after ten years of USDB’s request for a school building being turned down by legislators.</p>
		<h3>A Common Misconception of Mainstreaming</h3>
		<p>Despite the enactment of HB 296 and the new, permanent Salt Lake City school campus, USDB and school districts still interpret IDEA as mainstreaming being required. It was a common misconception that IDEA required mainstreaming. In fact, IDEA does not use the terms “mainstreaming” or “full inclusion.” What IDEA required was that every educational state agency and school district provide for a “continuum of educational placement options” from a regular classroom to a special day class to a special school to institutional and hospital placements (34 C.F.R. 300.551;20 U.S.C. 1412 (a) (5)).</p>
		<p>The following are example of placement options that have come up as interpretations to IDEA: State Residential Schools for the Deaf, Day Schools for the Deaf, Mainstream Classrooms including Self-Contained Classrooms, Private School, Resource Rooms, Inclusion Models, Itinerant Teacher Services, and Charter Schools (MENUS, 2002; NASDSE Educational Services Guidelines, 2006).</p>
		<p>The February 2007 Position Paper of the Conference of Educational Administrators of Schools and Programs for the Deaf (CEASD) emphasizes the importance of providing a full continuum of alternative educational placements as required by IDEA, including special schools (known as deaf schools) for deaf and hard of hearing students. CEASD finds that recent trend in our nation to remove special schools from the continuum to be unacceptable and potentially harmful to the child’s human development and clearly counter to the spirit of IDEA. Siegel (2000) notes that a truly effective and communication-based system recognizes that communication varies significantly among deaf and hard of hearing children, and thus the need for a variety of very different placement options and communication environment is fundamental to success (p.38). In other words, to truly succeed as a statewide school, USD needs to provide a larger array of choices for deaf and hard of hearing students in Utah including a residential school. However, going against Dr. Campbell’s and Dr. Sanderson’s recommendations, USD largely removed its residential school from classroom use on April 4, 2002. Thus, the full continuum was not available to our students and some of them run the danger of being placed in programs that are not LRE from the student’s point of view.</p>
		<p>According to Dr. Stephen C. Baldwin (1990), in 1988 Commission on Education of the Deaf ruled that the “least restrictive environment” need to be clarified by the federal government, particularly by the Department of Education. LRE had been the hottest issue ever to face the profession of education of the deaf. With mainstreaming setting and residential school for the deaf, each considered the other to be the “most restrictive environment” (p. 15 – 16).</p>
		<p>Often when people hear of the term “LRE,” they misinterpreted it to mean an environment in which the deaf and hard of hearing student’s needs are met on an equivalent level with the needs of students with non-disabilities (MENUS, 2002). However, the 2004 Reauthorization of IDEA states LRE could mean “Language Rich Environment” (DesGeorge, Johnson, & Brown, 2004). The February 2007 Position Paper of CEASD accepts this definition. It works for all communication methodologies: oral, total communication or ASL/English bilingual. To have the least restrictive environment (and optimum language acquisition), students need an environment in which they are surrounded by their chosen communication method.</p>
		<p>CEASD and several other projects and organizations recognize that access to communication should drive educational decision making, including placement decisions, throughout the IEP process for deaf and hard of hearing students. CEASD further states that because schools for the deaf are specifically designed for children with hearing loss, for many students, including those who are on grade level, they are the appropriate placement, and in fact, are the least restrictive environment in which they can achieve successful educational outcomes.</p>
		<p>When Dr. Robert Sanderson (1992) was on the Institutional Council, the IC went on record “that students need to be mainstreamed to the maximum when possible.” He wrote an article in which he stated that mainstreaming is not the answer for all deaf children. CEASD says the same thing when it mentions that a “least restrictive environment” is not a generic concept or a “one-size fits all,” but a concept that could be used depending on each child’s individual communication, language and educational needs, not the other way around.</p>
		<p>Siegel (2000) supports CEASD’s comment by stating, “Historically, any institutional effort to provide only “one way” to educate or place these children has not worked, and to think that an effective system will require and provide for only one kind of communication or one kind of placement is foolish at best. The issue before the American educational system is the need for a communication-rich environment for all its students, not the more narrowly drawn and confining notion of generic placement. The issue is not what communication mode is best, but that all communication needs must be addressed” (p. 4).</p>
		<p>Another important factor when considering educational/communication driven placement is critical mass that means there are at least eight to fifteen students in the same age group at similar cognitive/academic abilities. Siegel (2000) states that “because a critical mass of age, cognitive and language peers is fundamental to an effective educational system, the number of deaf and hard of hearing students and their geographic and age distraction have a fundamental impact on program quality and availability” (p. 15). Siegel also says, “critical mass can and must mean different things for different students. For a child who is “oral,” his or her neighborhood school with other children who use spoken language provides that child with necessary critical mass. For a deaf child who uses sign language, an area-wide program or school for the deaf will provide the necessary critical mass” (p. 6.).</p>
