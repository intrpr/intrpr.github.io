		<h1>Part II &#8212; Origin and Early Beginnings of the Utah School for the Deaf</h1>
		<p>August 1884 marked the beginning of a new era for the deaf in the territory of Utah. There were three major factors at work, which culminated in 1884 in the establishment of the Utah School for the Deaf. There were: the wide-spread interest throughout the United States in the education of the deaf, the deep rooted love for education in general felt by the early settlers of Utah, and the homogenous religious nature of the communities (Burdett, ??).</p>
		<h3>Interest in the Education of the Deaf</h3>
<p>From the time that the American School for the Deaf, the first deaf school was established in 1817, until 1875 twenty-three additional schools had been founded in the nation. Furthermore, the achievements of the educators of the deaf were described in extremely colorful language. In some cases the reports of their work were gross exaggerations. To the public the age of miracles was not past. It was an era in which teachers and laymen alike looked forward with unlimited expectations. Undoubtedly this spirit filtered into Utah and aroused interest and enthusiasm (Pace, 1946).</p>
		<h3>Early General Education in Utah</h3>
		<p>The early Mormon settlers were deeply interested in education. They entered the Salt Lake Valley late in July, 1947, and despite the extreme hardships of their pioneer life, a school had been established before the end of October. When the Legislative Assembly met in 1850, their second official act was the creation of the University of Deseret. This university was, in a sense, a board of education for the territory. It was primarily, a policy-making organization, and under its leadership, local schools were established throughout the region. Therefore, that early in its history Utah made provision for the education of its children with disabilities (Pace, 1946).</p>
		<h3>Religion as a Factor</h3>
		<p>The Utah pioneers were a deeply religious people. They believed that the spiritual welfare of their children was to depend on their ability to obtain knowledge. The parents of deaf children wished for them to get education within the territory. It was expensive to send children to deaf schools outside of the territory of Utah and the long period of separation from the family and church was undesirable. Many parents, especially Latter-day Saints desired to have more control over the school that taught and supervised their children along with having them closer to home. Additionally, the children came from the prominent families wanted them to be educated and shared a need to prepare them to function in the hearing world while living within the territory (Pace, 1946; Burdett, ??; Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<h3>Work of Joseph Beck and William Wood</h3>
		<p>The first effort to establish a school for the deaf in Utah was made by William Wood and Joseph Beck of Salt Lake City and both of them were parents of deaf children. Joseph Beck, a local mining magnate had three deaf sons, Joseph, John A., and Jacob who were attending the California Deaf School. William Wood, whose deaf daughter, Elizabeth was attending the school for the Deaf at Colorado Springs (Metcalf, 1900; Pace, 1947; Burdett, ??; Roberts, 1994). They were credited for originating the idea of instructing the deaf of Utah and they had the most to do with the founding of a school for the deaf in Utah (Clarke, 1897; Metcalf, 1898).</p>
		<p>At that time, the United States census of 1880 reported 118 deaf persons in the territory of Deseret, now Utah. Mr. Beck, in 1883 circulated a letter throughout the territory to find out how many of these deaf children were of school age. He received in reply the names of fifty children (Pace, 1946; Burdett, ??).</p>
		<p>At about the same time, the length of the journey and the expense for sending Elizabeth Wood to Colorado Springs led William Wood to decide and try to establish a school for the deaf. He learned of Joseph Beck’s efforts, he visited him in his home regarding the matter. They worked together collecting statistics on the status of the deaf in Utah. They decided to petition the legislature for the establishment of a school for the deaf (Metcalf, 1898; Pace, 1946; Burdett, ??).</p>
		<p>In 1883, Governor Eli Murray became interested in the cause. He called the attention of the legislature to the condition of the deaf in the territory and the need for a school where they could be properly educated (Pace, 1946; Burdett, ??).</p>
		<p>William Wood presented the petition and it was met with favorable consideration $4,000 ($2,000 per annum) was approved for the purpose of teaching a class for deaf children at the University of Deseret (later renamed to the University of Utah) on February 17, 1892 in Salt Lake City, Utah (Clarke, 1897; Metcalf, 1900, Burdett, ?? ). Wood donated $250 and Beck gave $500 towards the founding of Utah School for the Deaf (Clarke, 1897). The school connection with a university was the first of its kind in the nation.</p>
		<h3>The University of Deseret</h3>
		<p>In 1850 the Legislature Assembly of the Territory of Utah had created the University of Deseret. The chancellor and Board of Regents of the University had, in addition to administration over the “parent school,” general supervisory powers over all education within the territory. In its early beginnings it was, a state board of education, and was similar in function and personnel to the historic University of the State of New York, an institution which exercised control over all policies within the state (Pace, 1946, p. 10).</p>
		<p>In the main, throughout the territory, the schools were financed and administered by local board of trustees, with the supervision and advice of the Board of Regents of the University. Since the school for the Deaf had no local affiliations, a committee of three members of the Regents, known as the Deaf-Mute Committee became the administrative unit and exercised direct supervision over the school. The school of the deaf became a department of the “parent school” or the University proper (Pace, 1946, p. 10).</p>
		<h3>Opening of the School</h3>
		<p>After the act of establishing the Utah School for the Deaf and the appropriation bill were passed, the matter was left in the hands of Dr. John Rocky Park, President of the University of Deseret to make arrangements for starting a class for deaf pupils in connection with the University. He attempted to find a competent teacher of the deaf within the territory.  Failing in this, he made inquiries in the East in 1884 and met Dr. Edward M. Gallaudet, president of Gallaudet College. Dr. Gallaudet recommended employing Henry C. White, a deaf man from Boston as a teacher to take charge of such class. Upon Dr. Gallaudet’s recommendation, Henry was appointed principal of the Utah School for the Deaf by Dr. Park. On August 26, 1884, the class was opened in a room in the University building. Henry became the first principal of the Utah School for the Deaf in Salt Lake City and remained there as a teacher, principal and head teacher until 1890 (Fay, 1893; Clarke, 1897; Metcalf, 1900; The Utah Eagle, February 1922; Pace, 1946). At this time, the system of instruction used was the Combined System (Fay, 1893; Pace, 1946; Burdett, ??). <span class="revtag">changed 11/07/11</span></p>
		<p>The school opened August 26, 1884 in a room in the University Building. Professor White was appointed as the first teacher. He later served as the school first principal. He started a class with Elizabeth Wood, the only one pupil in attendance. By the end of September four students were enrolled. The total enrollment for the first year was fourteen. The second year it increased to eighteen. The aim of the school was to make its graduates competent for the business and social world (Fay, 1893; Pace, 1946).</p>
		<p>During the first two years, 1884 – 1886, the school was conducted as a day school. The students’ parents did not live in the city; they were boarded in various parts of the city. Professor White was effective in establishing a common home for deaf children residing outside the Salt Lake City area. However, this was not found to be satisfactory for parents. Thus, an effort was made to establish a common home for all deaf children (Pace, 1946; Burdett, ??).</p>
		<p>When the legislature convened in 1886, Professor White presented two petitions. The first petition, he requested an appropriation of $25,000 for the establishment of a territorial school for deaf children. Later, he introduced the amendment requesting $38,000 rather than the original sum. These were both objected, but the annual appropriation was raised from $2,000 to $3,000. These monies, however were never available, as the entire appropriation bill was vetoed by the governor (Pace, 1946; Burdett, ??).</p>
		<p>This action, however did not interrupt the sessions of the school, the Regents of the University, however assumed the responsibility of conducting the school until the legislature would come to their aid (Pace, 1946; Burdett, ??).</p>
		<p>In 1886, Professor White, on his own responsibility, began to board the pupils in his home in connection with the school. For its support, he depended on money received from parents to cover their children’s board, county aid, and donations from individuals. Salt Lake County made an annual appropriation of $900 for the support of five students (Pace, 1946; Burdett, ??).</p>
		<p>In 1887, the USD was moved to the spacious mansion and beautiful ground of Hooper place, formerly residence of Caption W.H. Hooper where it remained for three years while still connected to the University of Deseret (American Annals of the Deaf and Dumb, January 1888; American Annals of the Deaf and Dumb, October 1889; Fay, 1893).</p>

		<h3>Enabling Act of the School</h3>
		<p>In 1888, the Legislature Assembly enacted a law to establish and maintain, in connection with and as a branch of, the University of Deseret, a department to be known as the Institution of Deaf-Mutes. The law read in part:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Be it enacted by the Governor and Legislative Assembly of the Territory of Utah.</p>
			<p>That the Chancellor and Board of Regents of the University of Deseret shall establish and maintain in connection with and as a branch of said University and under the supervision and management of said Chancellor and Board of Regents, a department thereof, to be known as the Institution of Deaf-Mutes.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The principal object of said institution shall be to offer the means of education to the indigent deaf-mutes of this territory in the common branches of knowledge and in useful trades.</li>
				<li>Said Chancellor and Board of Regents may establish, in connection with said institution, a mechanical department, the nature of which shall be determined by said Board of Regents in which the pupils shall receive instruction.</li>
				<li>This session of the legislature further provided that the Board of Regents should erect, on the University grounds, such building for the use of the institution as they deemed advisable. A sum of $20,000 was appropriated for this purpose and the per annum appropriation was raised to $5,000.</li>
			</ol>
				<p>(Pace, 1946, p. 11).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The Utah State Legislature broadened this concept to provide for the education of the deaf, the deaf-mutes, and the mutes, under the age of thirty, who were of sound mind and body, who because of their deafness or muteness were unable to profit by instruction in the common schools of the state. The law specifically stated that the pupils be instructed in agriculture and the mechanical arts that would tend to enable them to become self-supporting (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>Further, the law provided free education at the school to all residents of the state. Pupils from other states might be admitted on any terms prescribed by the administrative board. The legislature further provided that the Board of Regents should erect, fund for the construction of a building on the University campus. A sum of $20,000 was appropriated for this purpose and the annual appropriation was raised to $5,000 per annum (Fay, 1893; Burdett, ??).</p>
	<p>This school became known as the Institute of Deaf-Mutes. It was later changed to the School for the Deaf and Dumb and finally to the Utah School for the Deaf. For 11 years the Institution of Deaf-Mutes continued as a part of the University of Deseret, the highest educational institute in the territory. It was the only school for the deaf in the United States that was connected with a university at that time. This connection made the school a part of the public school system of the territory, a birthright which has been of lasting benefit (Burdett, ??; Pace, 1946; Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<h3>A Replacement of Unpopular Principal</h3>
		<p>December 18, 1889 was Professor White’s 33rd birthday. His pupils surprised him by presenting him with a pretty double inkstand and a Russia leather wallet. He was “unspeakably” happy (The Silent Worker, December 1889). Professor White remained as principal of the school for five years. Besides his pupils, he acquired little to no popularity during his place as principal (The Silent Worker, September, 1897). He, although was unable to speak and was a versatile writer, was forced to give up his position to a hearing high school teacher of four years, Frank W. Metcalf from Kansas School for the Deaf (American Annals of the Deaf and Dumb, October 1889; Burdett, ??). When Frank was appointed principal in 1889, Henry became head teacher which position he held until February 1890. Due to Frank Metcalf’s appointed as principal, Henry felt very bitter against his successor and soon this bitterness caused trouble between these two men. An investigation was held before the Board of Regents after which Henry’s services with the school were discontinued. During Henry’s last year with the USD, Frank M. Driggs, then boys’ supervisor became acquainted with him, whom he found to be well educated, bright, alert and active. Henry was praised for his efforts to keep the school going during those early years when it required money and courage (The Utah Eagle, February 1922). <span class="revtag">changed 11/07/11</span></p>
	<p>Professor White was not alone in this situation. Men who were deaf founded schools for the deaf faced great obstacles and were removed from their positions as principals for no other cause. Hearing people wanted their places. Professor White, along with three other deaf principals, J.M. Koehler of Pennsylvania, A.R. Spear of North Dakota, and Mr. Long of the Indian Territory were recognized by the Deaf Community as shining lights in this particular, all men who built on firm foundations at the price of great discomfort and in the face of great sacrifices, only to be told to “get out” and make room for hearing men (The Silent Worker, March 1900). At that time, the Deaf community in the nation viewed Professor White as one of the founders, totally unaware of two parents, John Beck and William Wood’s involvement with the establishment of the Utah School for the Deaf.</p>
		<h3>1889 – An Eventful Year</h3>
		<p>In this year the enrollment of the school was increased from 18 to 37 pupils. In the spring of that year, the construction work was begun on a building to be used by the institution on the university grounds and the estimated cost was $50,000 (Burdett,??).</p>
		<p>Metcalf was appointed as principal of the school in 1889. He later became its first superintendent, a position he maintained until 1901. Under Metcalf’s administration, Professor White became the head teacher. However, he resigned his position and severed his connection with the institution in February 1890 (White, 1890; Fay, 1893; Pace, 1946; Burdett, ??; Utah School for the Deaf 100th Year Anniversary Alumni Reunion, 1984).</p>
		<p>While the deaf principals were losing their jobs, hundreds of deaf teachers were also dismissed from their jobs in favor of hearing teachers who did not know American Sign Language (Lane, 1984; Shapiro, 1994). Since the ravages of the Milan Conference of 1880, almost all teachers of the Deaf were hearing (Lane, Hoffmeister, &#38; Bahan, 1996).</p>
		<p>In addition, while the deaf leaders were battling against Alexandra Graham Bell and attempting to block the expansion of oral day schools across the United States in 1894, Henry C. White, a gifted rhetorician, graduate of the American School and Gallaudet College, faulted school administrators for their failure to consult directly with deaf adults. He asked, “What of the deaf themselves? “Have they no say in a matter which means intellectual life and death to them?” (Buchanan, 1850-1950, p. 28). During this period, Henry was one of the most farsighted deaf activists and he envisioned that the deaf activists were unable to mount the type of national campaign. Buchanan (1850-1950) added that Henry “believed that deaf instructors had a moral claim in teaching positions, but he understood that such assertions were nothing if they were not based in law and protected by vigilant deaf adults” (p.32). While Henry was employed at the Utah School for the Deaf in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1885, he urged his peers to define, organize, and defend a new set of rights. He maintained that “One thing must be made plain and if we wish to combat this lingering prejudice and secure justice...we must assert our claims to justice or we will never receive it (p. 32).”</p>
		<p>During the same year on September 15, 1894, Laron Pratt, Utah's first Deaf community leader and an assistant superintendent of the Latter-day Saint Deaf Mute Sunday School in Salt Lake City, made comments about deafness—both general and his own—in a public sermon to Salt Lake City’s Brighton Ward. Standing before a large audience, Pratt “pointed out to his attentive audience the Divine providence in his behalf in placing him under what most people regarded as an affliction, but in which he realized a blessing for the situation in life which he had occupied.” Considering the climate against manualist approaches at the time, Pratt’s declaration represented a very positive, forthright, and even religious opinion of deafness. The newspaper reported that Pratt’s “testimony made a deep and lasting impression upon the people, who felt the force of a remark by him to the effect that his apparent affliction was proving a blessing from which the disguise was being removed to his own comprehension" (Deseret News, September 15, 1894, p. 399).</p>

			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>The first copy of a small paper, “The Deseret Eagle” was published on October 10, 1889 (Pace, 1946; Burdett, ??).</p>
			<p>The Deseret Eagle stated that the Utah School had two pupils enrolled who were forty years of age, and quite a number who were over thirty, while the average age of new pupils was twenty-one. This disparity in the age of pupils was due to the comparatively short time. Utah had a school for the deaf, and even now after give years of existence, it had not become generally known that an educational institution of the kind was in operation (The Silent Worker, November 1889).</p>

		<h3>Provision Made for a Board of Trustees</h3>
		<p>Administrative of the Utah School for the Deaf was to be vested in a board of trustees consisting of five members, office of each member was to be six years. The board was required to hold four meetings a year at the school. Other meetings were to be called when necessary. Each board member was required to take the oath of office and provide a bond of $3,000.</p>
		<p>The board members were not to be paid for their services, but they were to receive compensation for the actual expenses incurred in the attending of meetings and the discharging of their duties. No member of the board was to be interested, directly or indirectly, in any contracts, or business transaction, involving any pecuniary compensation or benefit made in behalf of the school. The board was to appoint one of its members president, the term of office to be two years (Pace, 1946, p. 14).</p>
		<h4>Qualifications of the Superintendent</h4>
		<p>The board was to appoint a superintendent, who would also be the principal of the school. The superintendent was to be a competent, expert educator of the deaf, acquainted with school management and class instruction of deaf and mute children. He could be removed at any time by majority vote of the board (Pace, 1946, p. 14).</p>
		<h4>Duties of the Superintendent</h4>
		<p>The superintendent was to be responsible for the care of the premises and the property of the school. He was to be charged with the selection and dismissal, subject to the approval of the board, of all instructors and employees. He was to regulate the household, discipline the school, arrange and execute the course of study and manual training program. He was to supervise the children’s training in manners and morals and have general oversight of all internal affairs of the school. The superintendent and board of trustees should make a report to the Governor and Legislature during the first ten days of teach regular Legislative Assembly, showing the condition of the school, its income and expenditures, and such estimates and recommendations as the board deemed would be useful. The law provided that no partisan, political or sectarian religious doctrine should be taught in the school, and no political or religious belief should be required as a qualification of any pupil, instructor, officer, or employee of the school (Pace, 1946, p. 15).</p>
		<h3>Efforts to Have the School Separated from the University</h3>
		<p>At various times, efforts were made to separate the Institution from the University of Deseret, it being apparent that the work of the two educational institutions had little in common. In 1890, the first attempt was made to have the school moved to Fort Cameron, an abandoned military post in Beaver City, in the southern part of the territory. This effort failed (Fay, 1893).</p>
		<h3>Housing of the School</h3>
		<p>In 1890 the additional sum of $35,000 was appropriated by the legislature to complete the building already started. The building was occupied in December. Previous to this time, the school occupied rented buildings for dormitories and had schoolrooms in the University building (Fay, 1893). Between June and December of 1890 the school was housed at 267 West Second South Street, Salt Lake City. On December 24 the school occupied the newly constructed building on the University grounds (Fay, 1893).</p>
		<h3>Employment as Teacher of Frank M. Driggs</h3>
		<p>By 1891, 45 pupils were enrolled in the school. One pupil was from the State of Idaho and one from the Territory of Arizona. Three teachers were employed. Among them was Frank M. Driggs, a student at the University of Utah, and boys’ supervisor for the two preceding years (Pace, 1946).</p>
		<h3>Beginning of Speech Teaching</h3>
		<p>Until 1891 little effort had been made to teach the pupils articulation. An articulation – speech and lip-reading - teaching was introduced because the school believed that a large number of the pupils could be profitably taught speech and lip-reading. A teacher of these subjects was employed. Sixty-seven percent, or all those deemed young enough to profit thereby, received instruction in these two subjects that year. Speech and lip-reading were used as the mode of instruction in one class, the sign language being employed in the other two classes (Pace, 1946). Superintendent Metcalf’s wife, Florence Crandall Metcalf, formally employed at Kansas School for the Deaf as a teacher, became a teacher of the oral program. A class of pupils was taught totally by the oral method (Fay, 1893).</p>
		<p>An example of what deaf education was like at this time, the Utah Eagle magazine published in 1893 explaining the relationship between three aspects of deaf education to advocates and parents as follows:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Our method of instruction is that known as the American or combined method, as distinguished from the oral method. The combined method includes every means which it is possible to use to reach the mind and intelligence of the child. We use the sign language as a medium through which to teach written language to reach the understanding. We use the manual alphabet; teach by means of objects, actions, and pictures, anything to develop the child’s mind.</p>
			<p>We employ a special teacher to [teach] speech and speech reading. A class of our pupils are taught entirely by the oral method. Others are taught to speak and read lips...After our pupils have finished a course of instruction in our school, the college [Gallaudet] at Washington is open to them, where through college course can be pursued. A deaf child can thus be lifted from mental darkness into full light of knowledge and understanding.</p>
			<p>But we do not educate the mind alone, but the hand as well. Three trade classes are in successful operation. A class in printing, one in carpentry, and one in shoemaking (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h3>Second Attempt to Have the School Separated from the University</h3>
		<p>In 1892, a second attempt was to separate the Institution from the University of Utah and relocate it in a more desirable ground and building in Salt Lake City known as the “Industrial Home.” It was built and then unoccupied by the United State Government. Legislature requested the United States Congress to permit this building to be used as a school for the deaf for the period of not to exceed three years. The request met with approval of the House of Representative but failed to pass the Senate (Fay, 1893; Pace, 1946).</p>
		<h3>Separation from the University.</h3>
	<p>In 1892, the name of the “University of Deseret” was changed by legislative action to the “University of Utah.” The same act provided that the Board of Regents should retain its jurisdiction over the school for the deaf (Pace, 1946, p. 12).</p>
		<p>While the legislature was making plans for the establishment of a new school for both the deaf and the blind, John H. Clark, the thirteen-year-old editor of the <em>Eaglet</em>, wrote an article on February 15, 1894 sharing how thankful the pupils were with the plans of legislature. In his article, the legislature however was in doubt as to where they will have the school for the deaf erected. There was constant conversation among the pupils about their preferred locations. Some of the pupils who lived in the north area preferred that the legislature would have the building erected at Logan. Others who also lived in the north area wished the legislature would have the school erected near Fort Douglas where there was plenty of ground for all kind of sports. Most of the pupils who lived in the southern part of the Utah Territory were in favor of having it erected in Provo. Those who lived in that area expressed concerns that it would cost much money to get to Logan. They recognized that there were many deaf children living in the southern Utah, but their parents were too poor to afford to send their children to school in Salt Lake City. The concerns were expressed if the school is established in Logan, it will probably be far beyond the reach of the people in Southern Utah and it could lose some of the most promising pupils for their parents cannot afford to pay the expenses of such a long trip. They felt Provo would help reach the promising pupils to enroll at the school nearby (Clark, 1894).</p>
		<p>When the Constitutional Convention met in 1895, the subject of separation from the University of Utah again came up for consideration. Inasmuch as the Enabling Act, passed by Congress, gave to the school an endowment of 100,000 acres of land, it was now financially possible to separate the two institutions (Pace, 1946, p. 13).</p>
		<h3>Permanent Location of the School</h3>
		<p>In 1896, Utah School for the Deaf was finally granted separation from the University of Utah. As the school was separated from the University, the question of a suitable location arose. A number of localities attempted to secure the school, among them Ogden (Weber County), Ephraim (Sanpete County), Fort Cameron (Beaver County), and Fillmore (Millard County). A number of localities attempted to secure the school in Ogden.</p>
		<p>The Constitutional Convention decided that Ogden offered the greatest advantages and voted to locate the school there. The legislature decided to carry out the provisions of the Constitution Convention by locating the school in the buildings then occupied by the Territorial Reform School (Pace, 1946).</p>
		<h3>The School for the Deaf Relocated to Ogden</h3>
		<p>When Utah was admitted into the Union in 1896, the school was moved a 57-acre tract and became the permanent home of the Utah School for the Deaf on September 15, 1896. It was housed in the old Territorial Reform School in Ogden, a second largest city in the state and shared facilities in its initial days in Ogden (Pace, 1946). The deaf school was located at 20th Street and Monroe Avenue while the blind school was at 7th Street and Harrison Boulevard.</p>
		<p>It was hoped the change would give Superintendent Metcalf and his staff more room and better facilities (The Silent Worker, October 1896). At that time, a school for the blind and a governing board of five trustees were added. Both deaf and blind schools were governed by the same board and had the same superintendent. One of the well-known trustees of twenty-two years was Maud May Babcock (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>Ogden proved to be an excellent location for the Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind. All lines of railroads in Utah and adjoining states centered there. From nearly every point in Utah, Idaho and Nevada it could be reached without a change of railcars, an important consideration in the case of deaf children. Electric streetcars connected all parts of the city at that time and came within two blocks of the school’s main campus (Pace, 1946).</p>
		<h3>Appointment of the First Board of Trustees</h3>
		<p>Until January 1, 1896, the Utah School for the Deaf had been a department of the University of Utah, with which it had been connected for twelve years. Just prior to that date, the Board of Regents of the University of Utah held a meeting to discuss closing the school because the funds appropriate for its maintenance had been exhausted. At that time, Frank Metcalf, Superintendent of the USD, such a calamity that he offered to assume all the responsibility for the maintenance of the school and the payment of its bills until such time as the Legislature should make provision for its needs. This offer was accepted by the Regents by a solution adopted to that effect. He assumed the responsibility on the 1st of January 1896. Although the situation was brought immediately before the Legislature, it was the 12th of March before the Board of Trustees had been appointed and was able to have a meeting. The management had been appointed and was able to have a meeting and the management of the school transferred to its care. The first Board of Trustees was comprised of</p>
		<ul>
			<li> David Evans, President</li>
			<li>H.S. Emerson, Secretary</li>
			<li>Edwin Stratford</li>
			<li>A.W. Carlson</li>
			<li> M.H. Cannon</li>
			<li>W.F. Adams, Treasurer</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Location of the School</h3>
		<p>Ogden City proved to be an admirable location for the Utah School for the Deaf. All lines of railroads in Utah and adjoining states centered there. From nearly every point in Utah, Idaho, Nevada, and adjoining states, Ogden could be reached without a change of cars; a very important consideration in the case of deaf and blind children. Ogden at that time had a population of about 20,000 people. It offered many advantages of cities much larger. Its churches, schools, and business houses were excellent. Lines of electric street cars connected all parts of the city, and came within two blocks of the school’s main entrance. The school was located on the outskirts of the city at the junction of Monroe and 21st Streets (Pace, 1946, p. 15-16).</p>
		<h4>Sites and Buildings</h4>
		<p>The grounds of the Utah School for the Deaf were comprised of a tract of land with an area of 57 acres. 10 acres were reversed for the school buildings, lawns, and recreation grounds. A large fruit orchard of over 100 trees covered several acres. About 10 acres were in alfalfa, and another 10 acres in garden. A tract of 17 acres furnished pasture of the livestock of the school. The different sections were separated by lines of tall popular trees which must had made a most pleasing appearance.</p>
		<p>The school was housed in two buildings. The Main Building was a brick and stone structure with a metal roof. This building had a frontage of 142 feet and was three stories above the basement. The first two floors were used for classrooms and offices. The two top floors were used as a dormitory for boys and one end and for the girls at the other end.</p>
		<p>[PHOTO]</p>
		<h4>The “Blind Building”</h4>
		<p>A two-story brick and stone building 102 &#38; #215; 100 feet was located 100 feet in the rear of the Main Building. This was known as the Annex Building and later as the “Blind Building.” In this building were the main dining hall, assembly room, and Chapel. The second floor was used for industrial classes but was later changed to classrooms and a dormitory for the blind pupils. The kitchen, pantries, and a small dining room were in an addition to the building (Pace, 1946, p. 15-16).</p>
		<p>[PHOTO]</p>
		<h4>Fire Escape Cylinder</h4>
		<p>A tall, dark cylinder behind the Main Building and beside the Annex Building was a fire escape cylinder. It was attached to the second and third floors of the building, and had a helix slide metal by which any student could slide down and out of the door at the bottom of the cylinder. This method was to help students get out of the building quickly in case of fire.</p>
		<p>Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind had four fire escapes like this on the campus, and two of these were on opposite sides of the building for the blind. Two other fire escapes were found on the back side of the Main Building, one for the west side for the use of girls, while one was on the east side for the boys. The fire escapes were attached to the second, third, and fourth floors of the Main Building.</p>
		<p>The youths loved to slide down the fire escapes, which were several times higher than the slides found in public playgrounds. They even climbed up the slide to the second, third, or fourth floors, and then slid down. They had learned to stand up while sliding down and around the helix with their hand on the center pole. Once in a while, one of them would become mischievous, knowing that someone was climbing up the slide, and they would wait for a minute and then pour some water from the third story level onto the slide. Then the boy would slip and slide down the watery as fast he could, down to the outlet of the cylinder. His pants would be soaking wet (Walker, 2006).</p>

		<h4>Legends of the Fire Escape</h4>
	<p>Additionally, the fire escape stairs had bugged everyone at USD with wild stories. The questions were raised among the students, “What was it the round tower behind the Blind building?”
	Smokestack?
	Devil’s Pit?
	Devil’s Stove?
	Don’t Know?
	A story had passed down that one of the pupils who didn’t want to get troubles for giving out their names that they went into the wild ride in the fire escape stairs and came out with spider webs and dusts all over their clothes and bodies and popped up their body spines (USD Alumni Reunion, 2009).</p>
		<h3>Summary</h3>
		<p>From 1884 to 1896, the enrollment had increased from fourteen to fifty-five students. Instruction was given in speech and lip-reading, printing, carpentry, and shoemaking, cooking, sewing, and housework. The school was now on a firm basis and was ready to accept its rightful place as an independent educational institution serving the deaf children of the State of Utah, Idaho and the Territory of Arizona.</p>
	<p>[PHOTO]</p>
		<p>All those years, school functioned with three objectives.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Provided instruction in both oral and sign language for the deaf</li>
			<li>Furnished vocational training for students</li>
			<li>Taught educational skills like any other public schools. These skills allowed the deaf to be able to lead a productive life within a larger society (Roberts, 1994).</li>
		</ol>

			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>With the advent of Statehood this school [Utah School for the Deaf] fell heir to 100,000 acres of land and the school to be established for the blind to a like amount. As the constitution provided for the conducting of the two schools under the same management the combined institution had 200,000 of land to its credits or more than one-half land area of the State of Rhode Island (The Silent Worker, March 1896).</p>

		<h2>Expansion and Growth at the Utah School for the Deaf: 1896–1943</h2>
	<h3>Compulsory Attendance Law</h3>
		<p>A compulsory attendance law for Deaf children was passed in 1897. This law was unique in the education of the deaf in America in that failure to send a deaf child to school was punishable by imprisonment. The law provided that any parent or guardian of a totally deaf, mute, or blind child between the ages of eight and eighteen who, because of his handicap was unable to profit by instruction in the public school, is required to send the child to the State School for the Deaf or Blind for at least six months of the school year.</p>
		<p>Other states had similar laws. Individuals failing to comply with them may be fined from five to 200 dollars. In Utah, however, violation of the compulsory attendance act constitutes a misdemeanor. The maximum sentence for a misdemeanor is six months imprisonment in a county jail, a fine of 300 dollars, or both. The law made the following exceptions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the child is taught at home under the direction of a competent instructor</li>
			<li>If the child has acquired the branches of knowledge taught in the school</li>
			<li>If the child's physical or mental condition makes attendance unprofitable</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Since it was extremely difficult to measure the hearing of a young deaf child, and as a totally deaf child is very rare, the law was amended in 1907 to make the attendance of deaf or partially sighted children compulsory (Pace, 1946, p. 16).</p>
		<h3>First Hospital</h3>
		<p>In 1898 the legislature appropriated $35,000 to build a hospital, since isolation of contagious diseases was almost impossible with the facilities then available. The building, a two-story red brick structure, was completed in 1900. Much of the woodwork in the building was done by the students of the carpentry class. It was known as the maid's cottage (Pace, 1946, p. 17).</p>
		<h3>Resignation of Superintendent Frank W. Metcalf</h3>
<p>Superintendent Frank W. Metcalf presented his resignation to the board of trustees April 12, 1901. For twelve years he had served the school in the capacity of Superintendent. Under his direction the school had grown from a department of the University of Utah with three teachers, a principal, and forty-one pupils to an independent institution, with a superintendent, eight teachers, and an enrollment of 76 pupils. It was with deep regret and a keen appreciation of his work and efforts that the board accepted his resignation. The board at the same meeting appointed Frank M. Driggs superintendent of the school (Pace, 1946, p. 17).</p>
		<aside>
			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>&quot;According to the Kansas Star, Frank W. Metcalf, superintendent of Utah School for the Deaf had been displaced and Frank M. Driggs a teacher in that school stepped in his stead. The reason assigned for the change was that Metcalf is not a Mormon while his successor was one&quot; (The Silent Worker, May 1901).</p>
		</aside>
		<h3>Frank Milton Driggs</h3>
	<p>Frank Miton Driggs was born November 20, 1870, in Pleasant Grove, a son of Benjamin W. and Rosella Cox Driggs. On September 10, 1898, he married Maude Short in Salt Lake City, Utah. In October 1889, he came to the Utah School for the Deaf as supervisor of deaf boys. Two years later, he was appointed teacher and instructor of printing. When Utah became a state in 1896, the school was moved to Ogden. The following year he attended Gallaudet College as a normal student and later accepted a position in the Illinois School for the Deaf. His wife, Maude came in the picture at this time and went to Jacksonville with him. They returned to Utah after one year at the Illinois School for the Deaf in 1901. He became superintendent, succeeding, Frank W. Metcalf, a position he held until retiring in March 1941. He passed away at the age of 88 in 1959 (The Utah Eagle, March 1941; The Utah Eagle, March 1959).PHOTO</p>
		<h3>Later Period of Expansion under Frank M. Driggs</h3>
		<p>Frank M. Driggs received his education in the public schools of Utah County, Brigham Young Academy, and the University of Utah. He began his work with the deaf in 1889, when he was made boys' supervisor under Superintendent Metcalf. With the exception of one year at Gallaudet College and one year as teacher of the high class of the Illinois School at Jacksonville, Mr. Driggs continued his work as supervisor and later teacher at the Utah School for the Deaf until he assumed his duties as superintendent June 15, 1901 (Pace, 1946, p. 17).</p>
		<h4>The Greenhouse</h4>
		<p>A greenhouse was constructed in 1901 at a cost of $600. All of the mechanized work upon the building, except the heating plant, was done by the class in carpentry and the employees of the institution. A few years later it was rebuilt at a cost of $1,500 (Pace, 1946, p. 17).</p>
		<h4>The Gymnasium and Shop</h4>
		<p>The State Legislature in 1903 appropriated $12,000 for a building for the school for the blind, $5,000 for a new shop building, and $5,000 for a heating plant. It was found, when plans were drawn up and estimates given, that the needs of the school could be met more adequately by remodeling the second story of the annex building for the school for the blind, and by adding a gymnasium to the shop building. Superintendent Driggs and Mr. John Watson, President of the Board of Trustees, met with the State Board of Examiners and laid the new plans before them. The alterations in the plans were unanimously approved by the Board of Examiners and contracts were let for the shop and gymnasium building. It was completed shortly after school opened in 1903.</p>
<p>The new building was plain and substantial. It was constructed of red sandstone and sand-rolled brick. The west or shop end, was two stories high with a basement in addition. It housed the carpenter, shoe, printing, and barbershop, also a shop for the blind boys and some dressing rooms. The east end was the gymnasium. It was a room 40 &#38; #215; 60 feet (Pace, 1946, p. 17). Shops and a gymnasium were built on the east side of the Blind Building at a cost of $12,000 (Utah School for the Deaf: Historical and program summary: Brochure).</p>
<p>[PHOTO]</p>
		<h4>The Superintendent’s Cottage</h4>
		<p>The board of trustees in 1905 asked the Legislature for an appropriation for the erection of a Superintendent's Cottage. This appropriation was not granted. However, a larger number of pupils from Idaho than had been anticipated increased the revenue of the school. Permission was granted by the State Board of Examiners for the building of the house. The cottage was erected in 1906 at a total cost of $5,312.00 (Pace, 1946, p. 18).</p>
<p>[PHOTO]</p>
		<h3>Name of the School Changed</h3>
		<p>In the Biennial Report for 1905-06, Superintendent Driggs made the following statement:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>From the fact that all dumb children who are not deaf are feebleminded, and are, therefore, not eligible to admission to the Utah School for the Deaf and Dumb, and because of the further fact that we have no dumb children in the school, I would recommend that the Legislature be requested to eliminate the word "Dumb" from the name of the school making it to be "The Utah School for the Deaf." This will be a more correct name and will meet with the approval of public sentiment in this direction.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>At the session of the Legislature in 1907 the recommendation made by Frank M. Driggs was accepted and the official name of the school became the Utah State School for the Deaf. This seemed a much better name for the school since it had long been recognized that deaf did not speak because they did not hear speech sounds, rather than from disease or malformation of the vocal organs (Pace, 1946, p. 18).</p>
		<h3>Convention of the American Instructors of the Deaf</h3>
		<p>The meeting of the convention of American instructors of the Deaf was held in Ogden, Utah July 4-10, 1908. Extensive preparations were made for the care, comfort, and entertainment of the delegates and everything possible was done to make the convention successful. There were 145 guests present from other institutions representing thirty-two states, Canada, and the District of Columbia (Pace, 1946, p. 18-19).</p>
		<h3>Addition of the High School</h3>
		<p>A few subjects belonging to the high school course had been taught at the Utah School for the Deaf for a number of years, but not until 1907 was a complete high school offered to the graduates of the eighth grade. At that time the officers of the school decided to add at least one year of high school work; and if that proved satisfactory, more studies would be given until the whole four years course was completed. This they felt would give many of the graduates from the eighth grade who were unable to go to college, a chance to return to the school for one or more years of additional training; those pupils desiring a college education would be better prepared to enter Gallaudet College after having completed their high school work at home.</p>
		<p>The first year the high school proved very satisfactory. By the fall of 1909, a complete high school course of study was being taught at the school. It consisted of three years of Latin; the first, a course in Latin grammar, the two following years, courses in Latin translations from Caesar and Cicero. It was felt that this study of Latin would be a help to the pupils in English, since in order to make a good translation from Latin to English, it was necessary to think in English and not in signs, as was the students' custom.</p>
		<p>Four years of English were offered. Emphasis was placed on literature and composition. Algebra A and B were taught in first and second year high school. Algebra was considered a very valuable subject; since it was supposed to develop brain power and concentration of thought.</p>
		<p>Lillian Soderberg was the first student to complete the four years course and graduated from the high school in 1913 (Pace, 1946, p. 19).</p>
		<h3>Attorney General Made a Member of the Board of Trustees</h3>
		<p>In 1911 there was a slight change in the section of the law dealing with the Board of Trustees. It was amended and the government of the school was instructed to a board consisting of five citizens of the state and the Attorney General. Two members were to serve terms of four years; three for terms of six years (Pace, 1946, p. 19).</p>
		<h3>The School in 1912</h3>
		<p>The number of pupils enrolled for the school year 1911-12 was 102. These pupils were divided into ten classes with eleven teachers. The beginning class of seventeen pupils was taught by two teachers. All of the classes but one were taught by the oral method. In the oral classes, speech, lip-reading and writing were the means of communication and instruction. Eleven students were enrolled in the high school department. The course of study consisted of classes in speech, language, reading, numbers, good morals and polite manners, geography, history, penmanship, English, Latin, algebra, physiography, physics, botany, zoology, English history, chemistry, physiology, bookkeeping, typewritimy, physical education, domestic science, and manual training (Pace, 1946, p. 19).</p>
		<h3>New Hospital Constructed</h3>
		<p>In 1911 the Board of Trustees requested an appropriation of $7,000 for the construction of a new hospital building. The legislature granted the request but the governor did not approve the appropriation. In 1913, however, the sum was approved and the new hospital building was completed that year. The old hospital, remodeled and refurnished, provided quarters for the domestic science and art departments and it home for the older girls (Pace, 1946, p. 20).</p>
		<p>[PHOTO]</p>
		<h3>Primary Hall Completed</h3>
	<p>Funds to the amount of $37,000 for the construction of a new school building had been approved by the 1913 Legislature. Lack of funds in the State Treasury, however, prohibited the letting of contracts for its construction until 1915. It was completed in 1916 and was known as Primary Hall. It was a handsome fire-proof building of concrete and red brick. It contained five classrooms, four dormitories, four Housemothers' rooms, two play rooms, a reception room, a dining room, a kitchen, bathrooms, lavatories, sewing rooms, sleeping porches, and basement storerooms. This same building later served as the Food Services building (Pace, 1946, p. 20).</p>

			<h1>Did You Know</h1>
			<p>“Out in Utah they have been making some interesting experiments, at Mr. Frank M. Driggs’s school. All recent chapel talks have been conducted orally, and the story of “Mickey,” from Gene Stratton Porter’s story of Michael O’Halloran was told. Prizes were given to those pupils who gave the best written versions of the story as it had been related to them. Now the subject of the talks was a printed books, and while there is no intention or suggestion of collusion, or help from reading the book, the fact that it could be heal, and could be generally discussed detracts from the test’s accuracy. When these children go out into the world they will meet with condition very, very different from what obtain in a chapel. As a deaf man, I know that sitting an accomplishment, there are other things in life of even so clear that they are in signs and spelling, is wearying and a tax on endurance. What it must be when deaf people are supposed to understand by watching the movement of the lips, will be readily appreciated by hearing people, if they try to understand speech by seeing it spoken, and without hearing it uttered. Great as lip-reading is as a help and an accomplishment, there are other things in life of equal importance” (The Silent Worker, April 1917). [PHOTO]</p>
		</aside>
		<h3>Student Age Limit Changed</h3>
		<p>For 32 years, pupils up to thirty years of age had been permitted by law to receive the benefits of the institution. Inasmuch as a sufficient length of time elapsed for this unusual age limit to cover any neglected cases within the state, and it was manifestly undesirable to admit adults into an institution to live with and be educated with children, and as it was advisable to standardize the age limit with those of other states, the superintendent recommended that the age be lowered from thirty to twenty-one years. In accordance with this recommendation, the 1919 Legislature set the legal maximum age, at which pupils could be educated at the school, at twenty-one. It provided that an unusual cases persons who had passed that age might be admitted by attaining special permission from the Board of Trustees (Pace, 1946, p. 20).</p>
		<h3>Driggs Hall</h3>
		<p>The State Legislature in 1929 appropriated a sum of $100,000 as a special building fund for the construction of a girls' dormitory. In December of that year a contract was awarded to Whitmeyer and Sons and work was begun on the structure.</p>
		<p>The fire-proof red brick, caststone, and cement structure was completed the following year. This building was located in the west side of the school grounds, facing the east. There were two front and two end entrances. The first floor had two beautiful living rooms, eight dormitories with three beds in each, bathrooms, showers, cloak rooms, linen closets, storage and janitor closets, and two housemother's rooms. It also housed a fully equipped domestic science department. The second floor was a duplicate of the first floor, with a domestic art department there, instead of a domestic science department. The building could accommodate sixty-four girls and was so arranged that complete segregation of two, three or four groups was possible.</p>
		<p>The Board of Trustees, by unanimous resolution named the building "Driggs Hall" in honor of Superintendent Frank M. Driggs who had served the school as executive officer of the school for thirty years. The building was considered one of the finest dormitories for deaf girls in the United States (Pace, 1946, p. 20-21). [PHOTO]</p>
		<h3>Installation of the Radio-ear</h3>
		<p>In 1930 a radio ear was installed in one of the classrooms. It was an instrument which received sound through a microphone and amplified it in radio tubes. The sound was then transmitted to twelve desks which were equipped with individual amplifying dials and head receiving jets. It was believed that with regular and daily use, those pupils who had some residual hearing would be greatly benefited (Pace, 1946, p. 21).</p>
		<h3>Woodbury Hall</h3>
		<p>In 1934, a federal Works Progress Administration (WPA) grant for $100,000 was given to the school for the construction of a boys’ dormitory. A contract was let, and work began on the building during the summer months of that year. The building was completed and ready for occupancy by March 1935.</p>
		<p>The two-story building was located on the south side of the school grounds. It faced north towards the center of the campus. It was constructed of red brick with green and yellow tile trimming. It was 188 feet long and fifty feet wide. It contained thirty-two bedrooms, four reception rooms, four living rooms, and four supervisors' rooms. The basement contained three play rooms and several smaller rooms. The building had accommodations for 100 boys.</p>
		<p>In 1944, Superintendent Boyd E. Nelson and the faculty of the school requested permission from the Board of Trustees to name the building in honor of Mr. Max W. Woodbury, who bad served the school and deaf people of the state tirelessly for forty-two years. This request was granted, and in impressive ceremonies on April 28, 1944, the building was formally named "Woodbury Hall” (Pace, 1946, p. 21). [PHOTO]</p>
		<h3>Resignation of Dr. Driggs</h3>
		<p>At the Board of Trustees meeting held November 14, 1940, Dr. Driggs informed the Board that he would be eligible for retirement under the Teachers' Retirement Act in a very short time. He also told them he was willing to retire whenever they would release him and name his successor. The Board accepted his resignation with regret.</p>
		<p>For 52 years Dr. Driggs had been engaged in the education of the deaf children of the State of Utah. During this time he had held many positions of responsibility and leadership among the educators of the deaf in the United States. He had contributed extensively to the literature of his chosen profession, always stressing the importance of teaching English to the deaf. The splendid physical plant and scholastic make-up of the Utah School for the Deaf was a monument to his educational genius and leadership.</p>
		<p>On June 3, 1939, Gallaudet College conferred on Dr. Driggs an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters. The degree awarded and the citations made were as follows:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Frank M. Driggs, for half a century, friend of the deaf, leader in educational work for the deaf, an outstanding guide in better preparation of deaf young people for fuller and better lives, Doctor of Humane Letters (Pace, 1946, p. 21).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h3>Superintendent Dr. G. Oscar Russell </h3>
		<p>On February 27, 1941, Dr. G. Oscar Russell, professor of speech and director of the phonetics laboratory at Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, was appointed Superintendent of the Utah School for the Deaf. Dr. Russell had an international reputation as an authority on the human voice and on means of aiding the deaf to receive sound impressions.</p>
		<p>He was born in Conejos, Colorado. He received his bachelor's degree from the Brigham Young University and his doctor's degree from Columbia University. He had also studied in Berlin, Vienna, and Madrid (Pace, 1946, p. 22). Dr. Russell assumed his duties of superintendent April 1, 1941. However, most of the deaf students were not satisfied with his job performance. In addition, a lot of them did not like him because he had put radios in the dormitories (Kleda Quigley, personal communication, March 21, 2011). One of the students, Lyle Mortensen, class of 1943 as well as class of Gallaudet College 1948 developed a petition asking for termination of Russell. Numerous of students signed it. Lyle then submitted it to the Board of Trustee, which led Russell’s resignation after severing as a superintendent one year and seven months (Kenneth L. Kinner, personal communication, April 17, 2011). His resignation was effective immediately. His successor did not take office until the following January, hence, for a period of approximately two months the school was without a chief executive officer (Pace, 1946).</p>
		<h3>Superintendent Boyd E. Nelson </h3>
		<p>January 1, 1943 Mr. Boyd E. Nelson became the fourth superintendent of the Utah School for the Deaf (Pace, 1946). A native of Pleasant Grove, Utah, he was exceptionally well qualified for the position. He graduated from the Brigham Young University in 1932 and was Instructor of Public Speaking and Debating at Brigham Young University High School during the 1931-32 school year. He attended Columbia University and was awarded his masters' degree in the "Education of the Exceptional Child" in 1941. He was a student at Central Institute for the Deaf Teachers' Training College at St. Louis from 1934 to 1936. Before assuming his duties as superintendent of the Utah School he had been a teacher and speech clinician at the New Jersey School for the Deaf for six years.</p>
		<p>He had done extensive graduate work in a number of large universities throughout the nation and held several responsible positions in professional and civic organizations. He was well-known for his numerous and scholarly contributions to professional magazines and periodicals (Pace, 1946, p. 24).</p>
		<h3>Summary</h3>
		<p>Between 1896 and 1943, the Utah School for the Deaf enjoyed a period of wide expansion and growth. Superintendents Metcalf, Driggs, Russell, and Nelson guided the school to a permanent relocation in Ogden (occupied the grounds and buildings formerly used by the Territorial Reform School) in 1896 and helped establish it as a body corporate with laws for its proper government. Eight new buildings and several additional new services () expanded the school’s campus (Pace, 1946, p. 13).</p>
		<h2>Expansion and Growth at the Utah School for the Deaf: 1943–1950</h2>
		<h3>Campus Geography</h3>
		<p>The permanent location of the Utah School for the Deaf had been fixed by law at Ogden, Utah. The spacious and attractive grounds and the school buildings were laid out between Monroe and Quincy Avenues, facing Twentieth Street. The farm buildings extended north to the brow of the bench overlooking Ogden River and Lorin Farr Park. To the east farmland extended as far as Van Buren Avenue. A small amount of fruit, vegetables and alfalfa was raised on this part of the grounds. The school was reached by the Twentieth Street bus which went to the center of town and passes all bus and railway stations every twenty minutes. Walking distance was not great since the main business section of Ogden was only three blocks west and four south. Three city parks were near the school, as were most of the city’s representative churches.</p>
		<p>The school housed eight principal buildings:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>the Main Building, which housed the administrative offices and the class rooms for the intermediate and advanced departments</li>
			<li>the Blind Building, where the dining room and chapel were located</li>
			<li>the gymnasium and shop building</li>
			<li>Primary Hall, the home of the young deaf children</li>
			<li>Driggs Hall, the girls' dormitory</li>
			<li>Woodbury Hall, the dormitory for boys</li>
			<li>the hospital; the maids' cottage</li>
			<li>the superintendent's residence.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>While some of the buildings were old and obsolete, in the main, they were modern and beautiful (Pace, 1946, p. 23).</p>
		<h3>Administration of the School</h3>
		<p>In a special session of the Legislature in 1941 it was approved that the Board of Trustees of the Utah School for the Deaf be composed of the same people as the State Board of Education. They were vested with the power to make policies and conduct the business of the institution (Pace, 1946, 23-24).</p>
		<p>An advisory Council, consisting of five members, two of which must be women, was also formed. The duties of the council were to give advice and made recommendations to the Board of Trustees. The Board was not bound in any way to enact the suggestions and recommendations of the Advisory Council. The council was appointed by the Governor from the State of Utah at large. The legislature must approve the appointments (Pace, 1946, 23-24). Ray G. Wenger was the first deaf person who served on the Advisory Council.</p>
		<p>It was the Board of Trustees’ responsibility to appoint a superintendent, who is charged with the administration of the school. He may be removed from office by a two-thirds majority vote of the Board (Pace, 1946, p. 23-24).</p>
		<h3>Organization of the School</h3>
		<p>The school was divided into three departments; primary, advanced, and vocational with a head teacher or director in charge of each department. The work of all three of the departments was closely coordinated (Pace, 1946, p. 24).</p>
		<h4>Primary Hall</h4>
		<p>For the first five years, young deaf children were kept in a unit separate and apart from the rest of the school. These children lived, slept and carried on their class work in a separate building. Their played activities were also segregated from that of the older students. All their instructions carried on through the medium of speech and lip-reading. In order to establish speech as a means of communication, signs and finger spelling were discouraged among them as much as possible. The building in which the children live was called Primary Hall. It had its own kitchen staff and housemothers. Its teaching program was determined by its separate faculty. These teachers were presided over by a bead teacher, or supervisor, and they worked under the direction of the Principal Teacher.</p>
		<p>Each classroom was equipped with a splendid hearing aid and every possible use was made of any hearing the children have. The first three years were preparatory. They left the primary department after the second grade (Pace, 1946, p. 24).</p>
		<h4>The Intermediate and Advanced Departments</h4>
		<p>All children aged 3 to 12 were included in the intermediate and advanced departments. All instruction in the academic work was by the use of lip-reading and spoken and written language. Spoken and written language forms were emphasized in all class work. The pupils were given the same studies as those given in public schools, with the additional classes in speech and lip-reading. Group hearing aids were used in all intermediate grades (Pace, 1946, p. 24-25)</p>
		<h4>Vocational Department</h4>
		<p>At the beginning of the 1943-44 school year, a vocational department, with a special director, was established at the Utah School for the Deaf. A number of students who apparently would not continue their education to regular high school graduation were designated as vocational students. While they took courses in language, mathematics and science, in addition to their shop training, special attention was given to the vocational aspects of these studies.</p>
		<p>Courses were given in carpentry, printing, linotyping (typesetting), upholstery, shoe repairing, barbering, agriculture, sewing and dressmaking, domestic science, drafting and home mechanics, bookkeeping, typing, photography, hotel service, and arts and craft which includes pottery and leather handicrafts.</p>
		<p>The State Department of Vocational Rehabilitation cooperated very closely with the USD. A guidance program for each student who completed his formal schooling was planned by the officers of the two departments. Frequent interviews and regular reports from pupils and directors resulted in continuous and active pupil guidance. This cooperation also extended to placement and follow-up of former pupils.</p>
		<p>A significant part of the vocational program during the past few years had been given at Weber College. Machine shop studies were given to the boys and a power operation course was given to the girls. The Utah State School for the Deaf, the State Department of Vocational Rehabilitation, and Weber College were all under direct supervision of the State Board of Education which had encouraged and approved policies of cooperation between the three organizations (Pace, 1946, p.25).</p>
		<h4>Makeup of the School Staff</h4>
		<p>The staff of the school consisted of the superintendent, the principal, head teacher, director of vocational education and primary supervisor, a secretary and treasurer, a physician and surgeon, an eye, ear, nose and throat specialist, a dentist, a dietitian, a nurse, a farm director and instructor, and fourteen teachers. Of these fourteen, four were part-time teachers, with duties in other departments of the school. Seven housemothers, or supervisors were employed. The teachers had formed their own professional association and held regular meetings to discuss their problems. A number of lectures were given each year by prominent educational leaders of the State. Their high professional standard was evidenced by the fact that every teacher was a member of the Utah Educational Association. In addition, they held membership at least one of the following organizations: National Education Association, American Association to Promote Speech to the Deaf, or the American Instructors of the Deaf. Faculty and Department meetings were held regularly (Pace, 1946, p. 25).</p>
		<h3>The Health of Students at the School</h3>
		<h4>Causes of Deafness</h4>
		<p>A survey of the causes of deafness among the children enrolled results in a lengthy list of diseases such as meningitis, scarlet fever, influenza, whooping cough, and measles. They were most frequent. Hereditary caused account for about five percent; in a great many cases the cause was unknown. It was frequently difficult to determine the actual cause of deafness or to establish the age at which deafness occurred. However, it can be assumed, from the evidence that was reliable, that at least two-thirds of the pupils are adventitiously deaf. This meant they were born with hearing, but became deaf later through illness or accident (Pace, 1946, p. 25-26).</p>
		<h4>Examinations and Tests</h4>
		<p>Physical examinations were made at the opening of school by the school physician. Any needed corrections were reported to the parents. The children were weighed and measured annually by the school nurse. Periodical dental examinations were given. This year chest X-rays were made of all pupils and employees. Vaccination and immunization precautions were taken. Careful charts and records were kept by the nurse of all physical examinations and illnesses of the children.</p>
		<p>Individual audiometer tests were given during the first school year and periodically thereafter. These were used to aid in determining placement and instructional method given the child. Group intelligence tests were a regular part of the school testing program. In isolated instances individual performance tests were administered. Standardized reading tests were given in the primary department at the close of the school year. The intermediate and advanced departments gave standardized achievement tests (Pace, 1946, p. 25-26).</p>
		<h3>Teacher Training</h3>
		<p>In connection with the University of Utah Extension Division, teachers in Ogden, took accredited courses in special education. These courses were approved by the state committee on certification of teachers. In the past few years courses have been given in Principles and Pedagogy of Lip-Reading and Guidance of Exceptional Children (Pace, 1946, p. 27).</p>
		<h3>Other Services</h3>
		<p>The Utah School for the Deaf offered a number of services to the community and state in addition to its regular school program. For the past two years a course in lip-reading was given at the school for adults who had impaired hearing. Classes had been held each Monday night of the school year. This course had been taught by members of the school's teaching staff. A large number of audiometer tests had been given to children and adults throughout the state. In Ogden this had been in cooperation with the Department of Public Health. In other communities it has been a program of the local school districts and the State Office of Rehabilitation. The school had come to be a focal point for many of the fraternal activities of the adult deaf of this region (Pace, 1946, p. 27).</p>
		<h3>A Look to the Future</h3>
		<p>In the past ten years there had been a decided drop in the total enrollment of the deaf pupils in schools throughout the nation. This has been brought about through immunization and prevention of the diseases which in the past have caused deafness. Better care and treatment when the diseases had been contracted have further lowered the, number of cases of deafness. The research and experimentation with penicillin and the sulfa drugs would indicate that through their proper administration adventitious deafness will be further reduced. In view of these facts, it was likely that the enrollment of schools for the deaf will become progressively smaller.</p>
		<p>Great strides in transportation by railroads, airplanes, and automobiles have brought remote regions much closer together. In view of these facts, steps had been taken to consolidate schools for the deaf into regional rather than state institutions. On February 15th and 16th, 1946, meetings of the National Committee on Interstate Cooperation were held in Salt Lake City. These meetings were for the purpose of discussing the consolidation of all state institutions. The possibility of educating the deaf students of high school age in one centrally located school was given careful consideration.</p>
		<p>At a meeting held in April, 1946, a committee on Interstate Institutions made the following recommendations:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<ol>
			<li>There should be established in some western college a training center for educators in all special institutions, special classes and social services and that the states adopt minimum standards for workers and administrators in specialized services.</li>
			<li>Special classes for the deaf, whether established in connection with public schools or otherwise should be under the direct supervision of the head of the State School or special department for the deaf in order to insure minimum standards.</li>
			<li>That existing schools for the deaf concentrate on the education of deaf children on the pre-vocational level in each state and that the western states cooperate in establishing centers with adequate academic vocational and social facilities for the training of advanced pupils. At present it is impossible for any one state to provide diversified training needed by older deaf children.</li>
		</ol>
		</blockquote>
		<p>In effectuating the above program that the state in which an institution was located shall have charge of and be responsible for the government of said institution. In cases where states have by compact entered into regional cooperation for institutional care each shall be entitled to representation oil a regional advisory council for such institution.</p>
		<p>While it was yet too early to predict the final outcome of this move, it was not improbable that the next few years will bring drastic changes in the organization of the Utah School for the Deaf. For sixty-two years the Utah School for the Deaf has served the children of Utah, Arizona, Idaho and Wyoming, who were deaf. In 1953, the State Legislature appropriated the sum of $500,000 for the construction of an administrative-classroom building. The new main building of was built in front of the old Main Building while the school was still in progress. The building contained modern classrooms, a fine media center, audiometric testing rooms, a gymnasium-auditorium and administrative offices. The building was originally shared with the School for the Blind. After the new building was completed, the old building demolished (Pace, 1946, p. 27-28). [PHOTO]</p>
		<h3>The Primary Classroom Building</h3>
		<p>The 1959 State Legislature appropriated the sum of $300,000 for the construction of a classroom unit for the School for the Blind, which shared the campus with the School for the Deaf from 1896 until 1969. The classroom until was completed in time for the opening of the 1962-63 school year. Included in the building were classrooms, arts and crafts rooms, music rooms, a library, a combination auditorium-activity room, administrative office, and teacher preparation rooms. This building became the Primary Classroom Building of the School for the Deaf in January 1969. The new facilities for the School for the Blind were completed at the old Tuberculosis Hospital during the same year.	June of 1971 saw the completion of remodeling of the Primary classroom Building. One wing of the “L” shaped building was remodeled to provide dormitory space for the younger children at the School for the Deaf. The Utah State Legislature appropriated a sum of $45,000 for this project (Utah School for the Deaf: Historical and program summary: Brochure).</p>
		<h3>Construction of the Industrial Arts Building</h3>
		<p>The elaborate Industrial Arts Building, constructed at a cost of $569,000, was completed in August 1966. It provided facilities for instruction in barbering, commercial subjects, data processing, home-living skills, tailoring and dry cleaning, graphic arts, leather repair, autobody and sheet metal, upholstery, drafting, elementary painting and finishing, elementary plumbing, arts and crafts, auto trim and beauty culture. In addition to a lecture room, there was an office for the Division of Rehabilitation Services and an evaluation room, plus an administrative office.</p>
		<p>During the summer of 1968, six second floor dormitory and living rooms, two dining rooms and the main kitchen, all located in what was formerly Primary Hall, were remodeled. This provided a modern two-floor dining facility. A grant of $23,000 from the Elementary-Secondary Education Act, Title 1, plus a $65,000 state appropriation provided for the remodeling and renovation. Great care was taken to create a home-like atmosphere in an effort to “de-institutionalize” the dining areas (Utah School for the Deaf: Historical and program summary: Brochure).</p>
		<h3>Construction of the Vehicle Maintenance Center</h3>
		<p>A long awaited dual facility was completed and first used in 1976. This addition to the Maintenance Shop consisted of a Vehicle Maintenance Center coupled with a Central Receiving Center at a total cost of $72,000. The aforementioned addition results in much greater efficiency in the care and maintained of all motorized vehicles. A central receiving point for supplier and equipment coming to the Schools enables the accounting division to maintain accounts with suppliers on a significantly more current basis. Receiving supplies and equipment in a central location also enabled the accounting division to greatly increase its ability to maintain and manage an ever enlarging inventory. The final building facility was added to the campus in the spring of 1976 at which time an athletic field house was donated to the school and moved to the campus. The all-metal building which formerly served as a service station was to be developed into dressing, locker and shower rooms with accompanying toilets to accommodate athletes using their outdoor athletic fields (Utah School for the Deaf: Historical and program summary: Brochure).</p>
		<h3>Summary</h3>
		<p>The School established oral and vocal training as part of the curriculum in 1891 and smaller children were provided a separate building in 1916 in order that speech and lip-reading could be more firmly established. Prior to World War II, vocational work had received added emphasis. The school had always been governed by a Board of Trustees, although the laws concerning this body had been amended and changed several times. Irma Acord Pace’s 1946 thesis at the University of Utah about the School commented that “The Utah School for the Deaf has tried continuously to provide an education for those under its care, which would enable them to become happy, self-supporting, useful citizens in their own communities” (Pace, 1946, p. 28).</p>
		<h2>The State Training School in American Fork, Utah</h2>
		<p>During the early years of Utah School for the Deaf, deaf children from the age of six and up to any age were allowed to enroll the school. The object of the institution was to provide a thorough education where the students were taught the course of study comprised of writing, reading, arithmetic, geography, grammar, history, physiology, civics, physics, and etc. The courses in manual (trade) training, physical training and domestic science were also provided (Driggs, 1901). Superintendent Frank M. Driggs aimed to give to every deaf child a good school education, and to prepare those who desire high education and show sufficient scholarship for entrance to Gallaudet College (Driggs, 1905).</p>
		<p>As the age of the students decreased, the enrollment of students with mentally ills or multi-disabilities was increasing at school because their parents did not have resources for them (Roberts, 1994). Between 1884–1889, the school’s student register noted that five percent of the students made no progress as a result of mental retardation. Furthermore, ten students made no academic progress due to their mental illness (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>Because most parents did not have the education or experience to help their children, they did not know what to do except to enroll them to USD for services no matter their age or additional disability. In the meantime, USD had difficulty determining the differences between the deaf, mentally disabilities, mentally ill, and autistic (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>In the first few years, USD accepted many students with additional disabilities who belonged at other institutions. However, these students provided a challenge to USD because the staff members did not have the expertise to deal with these students and accomplish the activities they wanted for the deaf. Many students were asked to return home within a few weeks because they could not learn or were disruptive. Others remained for a year or longer with no sign of progress. Some parents transferred a few students to specialized schools or mental institutions out of the state (Roberts, 1994). An example of dismissal of one young woman in 1898, Clara Eddy Martin, a deaf teacher shared a version of one incident:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>At that time students at the school ranged from six to thirty-two years of age. One girl named Rebecca was thirty two...Several of these students were in their twenties. These older students were often the most difficult to manage. ...Elmo Kemp, one of the star athletes, loved to tease and [he] began teasing her. Rebecca had a violent temper when arouse, [and] she chased Elmo around the table with [a] knife...</p>
			<p>After everyone left the room I went to her to talk to her for a few minutes [sic]. Finally she accompanied me to her room and I was in her good graces.”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>However, the school administration requested Rebecca’s parents remove her from the school (Roberts, 1994, p. 43-44).</p>
		<p>Several sources, including the staff of USD supported a separate institution for the students with multi-disabilities. Superintendent Frank M. Driggs, second superintendent from 1901 to 1941, took action in requesting legislature on the need of a new separate institution. He stated in his 1901 report,</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Every year we receive a number of applications for the admission to our institution of feeble minded children. These unfortunate boys and girls range in feeble mindedness from slightly below the normal child to the idiotic, imbecile, and insane. Almost all the applicants are dumb, or partly so, and usually have perfect hearing...Nearly every dumb child with perfect hearing is feeble minded.”</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Despite the lobbying effort of Superintendent Driggs and others, the legislature failed to act in setting up a separate school. It took several years for the legislature to recognize the need for a school for the students with multi-disabilities. In 1907, the state finally established the State Training School in American Fork. Thereafter, the number of students with multi-disabilities admitted to USD gradually diminished (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<p>Superintendent Driggs clarified that the institution was a school, not an asylum as many thought. This school aimed to educate mentally, morally, and physically for all the deaf students and faculty members were expertise to train students for a future employment opportunity (Driggs, 1901).</p>
		<p>Before 1890, the students enrolled at USD came to school at later ages, and returned home earlier. Many remained dependent on other family members. Most of them had problems adjusting to formal education. Many did quite well in their vocational classes. However, they did not stay in school more than a year or two (Roberts, 1994). About 1890, the age of students began to drop dramatically as younger students enrolled at USD and older students gradually returned home. When Frank M. Driggs became a Superintendent in 1901, he changed the age limit to between the ages of six to twenty-one years. By 1902, the after age twenty of the majority of students had dropped. This marked a direct reversal of 1884 when only five of fourteen students enrolled before age fifteen. The younger students who started school at an earlier age learned to read and write. They became skilled in a trade, which would make them employable. They had the opportunity to be more independent and well educated than the earlier older students (Roberts, 1994).</p>

			<p>Superintendent Frank M. Driggs’ brother, Dr. Howard R. Driggs gave an inspiring talk entitled, “Punches from Dr. Driggs’ Talk” on the teaching English to the teacher on January 12, 1921. Dr. Driggs was a professor and authored “Live Language Lessons” and other texts in English.</p>
			<p>“Punches from Dr. Driggs’ Talk”</p>
			<p>Teachers of the deaf have special phases of English teaching to deaf with, but the work is not essentially different from English teaching in the schools for the hearing. If you go deep enough you get to bedrock....</p>
			<p>English is vital – the great central subject of the curriculum because it ramifies and connects with every other subject. It is like the steel framework of the skyscraper. No lesson is well taught unless some good English comes as a by-product from the work.</p>
			<p>Teach the child to visualize what he reads. This applies to arithmetic, geography, history and all subjects. Seeing words isn’t reading. A boy had just read aloud “The Village Blacksmith.” A visiting elocutionist asked him what he had read. He replied, “Words.” “What do you see behind the words?” she questioned. “White paper!” he responded. Seeing black words on white paper isn’t reading.</p>
			<p>You can’t make anyone cry or laugh unless the spirit of sorrow or the spirit of laughter is in your soul. Words are not dead. They live. They can sting like whip; or caress like a mother’s touch.</p>
			<p>A book should be a window of life to the child. He must visualize what he reads. Reading a page of history and getting names and dates isn’t reading history.</p>
			<p>One of the chief things teachers of our country must do is to train the child to think while he reads; to read between the lines as well as the lines.</p>
			<p>Especially important is it to train the child to express his thoughts in English so that other people can understand. A fellow may know a thing, but he always knows it better when he has told it well. Every teacher is a teacher of English. Teach a child in every subject to express himself in clear-cut English.</p>
			<p>A great deal of the teaching of English has been the hanging of empty facts in the child’s mind. Place the emphasis on the life side of our work. Our business in teaching these grammatical forms is to make these forms carry over until they become vitalized in the child’s life – vitalized as does the incandescent globe become when the current is turned on (Driggs, The Silent Worker, February 1921).</p>

		<h2>Controversies Surrounding Communication and Educational Methods and Educational Placement Regarding the Interpretation of “Least Restrictive Environment”</h2>
		<h3>An Introduction of Combined System</h3>
		<p>During the administration of Superintendent Frank M. Driggs, he started the combined method using the manual alphabet, signs, speech and speech reading. In 1902, a statement on the methods of teaching the language skills was introduced:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The method employed in the school for the Deaf and Dumb is what is called the ‘Combined System.’ This system in vogue in most of the state institutions for the deaf in America. It is the combination of the oral and manual method of instruction. It is the system that brings the greatest benefit to the greatest number. Speech and lip reading are considered very important and are taught whenever the measure of success justifies the amount of time and labor expended. Mental development and acquisition of English are thought to be of greater importance, therefore, whenever a child fails to acquire satisfactory speech the manual method is employed....Speech, the manual alphabet, writing and sign language are used, simply, as tools, to further his attainments (Roberts, 1994, p. 61-62).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>As the head of the school, Superintendent Driggs (1901-1941) was the prime target for every emotion-wrought parent who brought a young deaf child there for the first time and asked, “Will my child be able to speak and read lips?” Although he emphasized the teaching of speech for the deaf, he was in the position where he had to determine what methods to include in the education of the deaf and hard of hearing that would benefit them. Additionally, he had to choose between Oralism and Manualism – the two methods, which had been in violent, conflict since the beginning of education of the deaf (UAD Bulletin, April 1959).</p>

			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>Superintendent Frank M. Driggs’s quote: “I love the sign language. I know how to use it well. It was a great boon to the deaf. They loved it dearly, too dearly sometimes. I wished every deaf child could be taught to speak well and read the lips well. These things were wonderful accomplishment and much to be desired” (The Silent Worker, June 1927).</p>
		</aside>
		<p>In the early history of USD, an oral teacher was employed to help with speech and language skills and several teachers were proficient in sign language. At this time, if students had difficulty with speech, then sign language became the preferred means of learning (Roberts, 1994). Over the years, many hearing parents had gradually preferred their children not to learn sign language and wanted them to totally rely on lip reading and speech for communication while deaf individuals spoke loudly against it (Roberts, 1994).</p>
		<aside>
			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>Arthur Wenger (USD ’13) wrote an example in the Silent Worker magazine of Superintendent Driggs’ emphasis in learning the new words among the deaf pupils:</p>
			<p>“The walnuts shake up and the beans ‘shimmy’ down,” responded Ralph to Superintendent Driggs’ question during chapel services. The space occupied by the word shimmy had been left open for the children to fill. This was one of the Superintendent’s methods of introducing new words and their proper application. In the word shimmy the boy stated his opinion of the conduct of the beans through the smile (?) of the dance. Of course the accepted word was “rattle” but this was only an illustration of the general use of judgment. The full text of the chapel talk was seldom forgotten. It was easily remembered as a container of a new word and as a model of its use” (The Silent Worker, January 1921).</p>

		<h3>Communication Methods of Instruction at the Utah School for the Deaf</h3>
		<p>The education of the deaf had long been a contentious issue in the nation. Between the dominant society that views deaf people as defective hearing people, and the deaf minority that continued to fight for the right to be educated in an accessible language, the education of the deaf continued to be an area of immense debate. This debate was no stranger to Utah, as the Utah Association of the Deaf, which was founded in 1909, had protested this issue in the past (Jeff Pollock, personal communication, May 4, 2005).</p>
		<p>In 1950s at the Utah School for the Deaf, three basic methods of instruction were eventually offered and they were: The Manual Method, the Oral Method, and the Combined Method. USD alumni of UAD had been exposed to each of the three basic methods of instruction. As a result, similar to the Deaf community nationwide, large number of members of the UAD supported the Combined Method.</p>
		<p>In July 1955, the National Association of the Deaf had its convention and they reaffirmed its support of the Combined Method of instruction (Burnett &#38; Sanderson, 1955-1956).
		During the administration of Superintendent Harold W. Green (1954-1959), between 1955 and 1956, USD reported in public that its primary classes were to be taught in the Oral Method, and that a gradual switch over to the Combined Method would occur during the later intermediate grades. UAD stated that they believed there were a number of inherent drawbacks in early oral instruction, which unduly interfered with the equality of education of each child to progress accordingly to his ability (Burnett &#38; #38; Sanderson, 1955-1956).</p>
		<p>The Utah State Board of Education appointed a committee of 18 citizens to investigate the educational methods in use at the Utah School for the Deaf. The chairman of the committee was Elmer H. Brown of Salt Lake City. Ray G. Wenger, Utah’s outstanding champion of the deaf, was one of the committee members (Burnett &#38; Sanderson, 1955-1956).
		UAD supported the investigation as long as it was conducted with an honest, fair, and impartial attitude. UAD requested that all sides be given equal opportunity to be heard. Prejudice or bias was emphasized not to be placed in the investigation.</p>
		<p>While the investigation was in progress, the USD Alumni and the adult deaf of UAD presented their views on educational methods and related subjects to the general public, to educators, to parents, and especially to the members of the investigating committee. Throughout the investigation, the view was that Utah School for the Deaf, a residential school, was the best possible place for the deaf children to acquire their education. They would be enrolled in a fine vocational training program, allowing them to have an advantage over a normal hearing child in preparing for future jobs and also find immediate jobs upon graduation. Additionally, they felt a residential school would provide a better social life for deaf children. From their experience in an inadequate oral program, they felt the parents should be aware that the purely oral method was not an adequate program in educating a deaf child.</p>
		<p>UAD emphasized the importance of deaf children receiving adequate education by developing their academic skills in reading, writing, and arithmetic. They believed that once their three basic subjects were mastered, lip reading and speech could be more easily learn as valuable social arts. Lastly, they expressed their concern about Utah School for the Deaf educational program. They felt there was a lack of positive direction. They also felt USD should develop a definite goal for potential students, and the goal should be college. At this time, high school students were not urged to prepare themselves for college, nor were they directly taught what benefits they could derive from higher education. It was suggested that USD provide college preparation for students in the first year of high school and the whole program should be planned around college entrance requirements (Burnett &#38; Sanderson, 1955-1956).</p>
		<p>In 1956, Joseph B. Burnett, president of Utah Association of the Deaf, and the UAD officers had been engaged in a bitter battle with proponents of oral methods of instruction of the deaf. They tried to preserve what they felt was most valuable at Utah School for the Deaf: The Combined Method of instruction. During the past several years, the trend had been to more oral instruction, with consequent loss of educational standards. UAD officers understood that it was very difficult to make normal hearing persons understand what the deaf accept as a matter of simple fact. They emphatically stated that:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>EDUCATION IS MORE IMPORTANT TO THE DEAF THAN THE MERE ABILITY TO SPEAK AND READ LIPS! And the most efficient and quickest way to educate deaf children is competent application of the Combined Method (Burnett &#38; Sanderson, UAD Bulletin, 1955-1956, p. 3).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The result of the investigation of the educational methods is unknown.</p>
		<p>Over the years, USD gradually provided two communication methodology programs: Oral and Simultaneous Communication.
			In April 1958, Ray G. Wenger, USD alumni of 1913, had served on the Advisory Committee since 1945 and was reappointed to the Advisory Committee for the Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind. Wenger was an ardent advocate for the Combined System as a means of communication among the education of the deaf. He devoted his many years of service in behalf of the deaf, particular in the field of deaf education. He is believed to be the first deaf person who joined the Advisory Committee (Burnett &#38; Sanderson, UAD Bulletin, 1955-1956).</p>

		<p>On March 19, 1959, the UAD Committee on Education, composed of USD alumni, Ned Wheeler, Leon Curtis, Gladys Wenger, Arthur Wenger (who was unavoidably absent) and Robert Sanderson, visited the Utah School for the Deaf to meet with the school officials. As alumnus, the committee asked them to keep them informed of the academic and vocational progresses. Due to limited time, the committee couldn’t assess fairly the results being achieved nor the value of the various methods, and the overall education was found to be satisfactory. While the small oral day schools were expanding, they confirmed the Utah School for the Deaf was still the best place for a deaf child to acquire a well-rounded education and sufficient vocational skills to become a useful member of the community (Sanderson, UAD Bulletin, 1959).</p>
		<aside>
			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>In reference to his outspoken methods over a preferred oral-only approach to Deaf education, Dr. Grant B. Bitter responded to comments made by the Deaf community:</p>
			<p>“You [the Deaf community] said that “education is thousand times more important to us than the mere ability to speak.” My friends, the ability to manipulate the mother tongue wisely and effectively in service to ones fellowmen is an integral part of education. It is basic to the development of competencies and saleable skills whereby individuals may fund meaning and purpose in life. Therefore, may we do nothing that would prevent and/or limit any child’s opportunity to give to the world that which only he can give as a person, worthy to take his place at the side of his fellowmen. Let us not relegate him to second class citizenship through isolation, causing him to become unnecessarily apprehensive, fearful, jealous, insecure and unproductive- rather may we inspire excellence in living – allowing him to give to the world something which only he can give in his uniqueness as a worthy person” (Grant B.

			<h3>Ray G. Wenger Addresses House Committee</h3>
			<p>At their own expense, on July 16, 1960, Ray and Arthur Wenger flew to Los Angeles, California, where Ray testified before a U.S. House of Representatives Committee holding hearings on a bill to provide training for teachers of the deaf. The original bill did not provide safeguards to prevent discrimination against deaf teachers of the deaf and would have made possible charging of the proposed advisory committee with opponents of the combined system of education. Officers of Utah Association of the Deaf campaigned to have this bill amended. Ray’s testimony added to the House’s records a forceful and effective presentation of their case that greatly impressed members of the committee (UAD Bulletin, Fall 1960).</p>

			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>In January 1921, Arthur Wenger shared in “The Silent Worker” magazine:</p>
			<p>“School work was hampered in its progress at one time by a group who thought that it was not necessary for the deaf to be educated: but when our boys and girls began to see that they were drifting on a raft without even a paddle, there came a speedy change and in the last few years the pupils had shown their realization of the value of high education by entering public high schools, college, and the State university with a desire to be on the same social and business plane as the hearing people.</p>
			<p>Last June [1920], three of our pupils were graduated from the public high schools; one from the high school at the School for the Deaf; and, one finished his second year at the University. This year we had one public high school entrant who was a senior and the principal’s office girl; three entrants at the Utah Agricultural College; and one at the University. Last summer there were three at the University summer school. Next year we expected at least three new entrants at the University and five elsewhere.</p>
			<p>With the exceptions, classroom lectures in the public schools mean little to the deaf, but our aspirants kept up and succeed in the end, through the use of books and questionings that more than offset their disadvantage in being unable to read the lips of the rapid speaker” (The Silent Worker, January 1921).</p>

		<h3>Dr. Robert G. Sanderson Defends the Utah School for the Deaf</h3>
		<p>On May 3, 1959, Dr. Robert G. Sanderson responded to William Smiley’s article, “It’s Leave Home or Education Ends” in April 20 advocating an oral day school in Salt Lake City, and published his article entitled “Ogden School Best for Deaf Children.” In his article, he defended against Smiley’s unfavorable impression toward the Utah School for the Deaf and the use of the manual alphabet and signs for communication. He understood that parents of deaf children had the right to request special classes for them in Salt Lake City. However, he spoke against the idea of parents being tricked and misled by oralists who valued lip-reading and speech more than education. Based on his and USD alumni’s personal experiences, USD is the best possible place for a deaf child. Dr. Sanderson emphasized that a deaf child at the residential school in Ogden gets a better education, similar to those hearing peers who attend a public school. He added that USD provides excellent academic instruction and vocational training in addition to the heavy stress placed on the art of lip-reading by expert and well trained teachers. He suggested that parents think first of their child’s education and last of their own emotions when trying to decide on where to enroll their deaf child. Lastly, Dr. Sanderson explained that sign language is their natural and normal means of communication and it is ridiculous for parents to deny their deaf children the use of it. He specifically stated that it is from our own experience with our own parents that we can only say this to parents of young deaf children: The sooner you both learn to spell the manual alphabet, the sooner you both will be able to communicate with each other and bridge the language barrier. Speech and lip-reading will come, sooner or later, each according to his/her ability.</p>
		<p>UAD members G. Leon Curtis (USD ’XX) and Ray G. Wenger (USD ’XX), also a member of the Advisory Council of the Utah School for the Deaf, backed Dr. Sanderson up by writing articles referring to William Smiley’s article as mentioned above and also Elizabeth H. Spear’s article, “The Case for Oral Education of Deaf.” Spear responded disagreeing with Dr. Sanderson’s article. In their articles, Curtis and Wenger recommended paying a visit to Utah School for the Deaf and meeting with Superintendent Robert W. Tegeder for a tour to see both sides. Seeing happy faces will be found to be sufficient evidence to convince anyone that the USD is doing an excellent job in many ways to produce happy, independent adults. Also, they clarified that both speech and manual methods were offered at USD (Sanderson, Salt Lake Tribune 1959).</p>
		<h3>Utah School for the Deaf Forms Extension Classes and Divisions</h3>
		<p>In cooperation with Dr. Allen E. Bateman, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Utah School for the Deaf and the Salt Lake City School District opened an extension class for deaf students on June 17, 1959 (The Utah Eagle, October &#38; November 1960; The Utah Eagle, January 1968). Parents, eager to have their children live at home rather than at a residential school, were also instrumental in the development of the Extension Division (The Utah Eagle, January 1968). Under the administration of USD Superintendent Robert W. Tegedger, in September 1959, he set up an Extension Division to allow deaf students to attend classes near home. These Utah School for the Deaf extension divisions and classes were eventually established throughout the state of Utah in order to provide a day program for aurally deaf children in more heavily populated areas (The Utah Eagle, October/November 1960).</p>
		<h4>Extension classes grow to respond to Deaf student diversity</h4>
		<p>A group of students in Salt Lake City, who had been enrolled at the Stewart Training School, founded by a group of parents of deaf children at the University of Utah in 1950s, had reached the age beyond which they could not remain in that school (The Utah Eagle, October &#38; November 1960; Jonathon Hodson, personal communication, May 29, 2011). At this stage the State of Utah became responsible for their education.</p>
		<p>By this time, the Utah School for the Deaf was already filled far beyond normal capacity, especially at this particular age level. The parents of these students were very cooperative and quite willing to keep them at home on a day class basic. The extension proposal seemed the only logical solution (The Utah Eagle, October &#38; November 1960). In 1959, Mary Burch of Kentucky and a graduate of Clarke School for the Deaf was persuaded to leave her comforts of retirements and heed to the plea of the Utah School for the Deaf to teach the extension class in Salt Lake City as an experiment. On May 30, 1960, the experiment was considered a success. When it was decided that the establishment of this program became part of USD, the Stewart Training School was closed (Tegeder, The Utah Eagle, October 1959; The Utah Eagle, October/November 1960). After the closure of the Stewart Training School, the enrollment in Salt Lake City expanded rapidly. Because USD faced tremendously crowded conditions on campus, two additional classes were created at Riley Elementary School in 1960 (The Utah Eagle, October &#38; November 1960). At first, the extension program was confined to the elementary school years and did not extend into the high school period. The students were to transfer to a regular school or transfer to the USD, where they received the necessary academic and vocational training for high school graduation (The Utah Eagle, October &#38; November 1960).</p>
		<p>Between 1961 and 1970, the Extension Division had grown from one class to over twenty classes across the state in cities like Salt Lake City, Ogden, Provo, Brigham City, Logan, and Vernal. The staff included teachers of the deaf, nursery teachers, teacher aides, consultants, volunteers, and a curriculum coordinator. Classes were taught at the preschool, kindergarten, elementary, junior high school and senior high school levels (The Utah Eagle, January 1968; Utah School for the Deaf 100th Year Anniversary Alumni Reunion, 1984).</p>
		<p>Teachers followed the curriculum of the USD in the lower grades. The curriculum in the upper grades was gradually adapted to parallel the curriculum of the Salt Lake City School Districts. Students in the Extension Division were moved to the curriculum followed by their learning counterparts as early as possible (The Utah Eagle, January 1968).</p>
		<p>All classes for the deaf were housed in public schools. The deaf children were integrated with hearing children on the playground and at lunch before an attempt was made to integrate them into the regular classroom. Some classes integrate as a whole with normal classes for activities such as physical education and there was some partial integration on an individual basis for one or more periods (The Utah Eagle, October &#38; November 1960; Utah School for the Deaf 100th Year Anniversary Alumni Reunion, 1984). The Instructional Program was administered the USD, in cooperation with the local school districts. It was offered to deaf children without at no cost to their parents. The program was financed entirely by the state through the USD and classroom space was rented from local school districts. This type of system still in practice today.

		<h3>Utah School for the Deaf Creates a Teacher Training Program</h3>
		<p>During the 1950’s, the Utah School for the Deaf found itself and the teachers un-certificated and unknowledgeable about the deafness. Hence, USD was asked to move with the University of Utah and its Department of Special Education in forming the first teacher training program for teachers of the deaf (Tony Christopulps, personal communication, November 5, 1986). There were no certificated teachers at USD until 1958. For the first time in the State of Utah actual certification standards for teacher of the deaf became effective in 1958 (The Utah Eagle, April 1958).</p>
		<h3>Oral Education Flourishes in Utah</h3>
<p>During the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, the methods for educating deaf students nationally began to shift from an oral/aural approach to an approach that incorporated sign language and other forms of pedagogy (simultaneous communication, or “sim-com”). However, several Utah practitioners and parents continued to believe in the oral/aural approach. Because of the deep philosophical differences between the two main communication methods, controversy started in the early 1960s. The oral education was beginning to flourish in Utah.</p>
		<p>In 1960, Utah School for the Deaf and its Extension program known as the Riley School in the Salt Lake area implemented an oral/aural approach in the classrooms as an experiment to test its effectiveness. The teachers, Dr. Grant B. Bitter, Tony Christopulos, Bruce Wallace, Duane Harrison, Thomas VanDrimmenlen, Albert Thurber, and Mary Burch advocated an oral/aural approach, which seeks to train the deaf students to use their residual hearing, speechreading, and listening skills to comprehend spoken communication and to develop "proper" speech skills. Furthermore, they marketed the experiment by inviting parents to observe the classrooms to gain support for leverage (Ronald Burdett, personal communication, 2009).</p>
		<p>Through the cooperative efforts of the University of Utah and the Utah School for the Deaf, the teacher-training program was established in 1961 under the Department of Speech Pathology and Audiology (This training program was later moved to the Department of Special Education in 1967-1968) that would supply the USD with future oral teachers of the deaf (The Utah Eagle, February 1968; Utah’s Hearing Impaired Children...At High Risk, 1986). Eventually, the problem arose when there was no teacher-training program for prospective teachers of the deaf who wanted to learn to sign and teach through the simultaneous communication style (Utah State Board of Education, 1973; Campbell, 1877; Utah’s Hearing Impaired Children...At High Risk, 1986).</p>
		<p>Dr. Bitter was a teacher of the deaf at the USD Extension program in Salt Lake City from 1960 to 1962 (Utahn, 1963). He coordinated the teacher training-oral program at the University of Utah on a part-time basis from its inception until 1971, when he became a full-time faculty member there (Utah Eagle, 1967; (Summary Report for Tenure, 1985). He administered and supervised this teacher-training program. In exchange, USD provided student teaching facilities, internship, and daily supervision (The Utah Eagle, February 1968; Summary Report for Tenure, 1985).</p>
		<p>Dr. Bitter allowed his personal bias to set the tone of the teacher preparation course at the University of Utah. In encouraging his deaf daughter to learn to speak, he became an ardent proponent for the oral teaching method. He developed the oral/aural teacher program, which was the only program of its kind in Utah (Summary Report for Tenure, 1985; Palmer, 1986; Baldwin, 1990). The main focus of this program for prospective teachers was how to get the deaf children to speak and how to get them to hear their lessons like a hearing child. The teachers did not learn to sign. This program produced a preponderance of teachers who were only trained in the oral/aural method. While the oral training program was being implemented, the USD built up a reservoir of teachers who were trained in oral method instruction. Furthermore, teachers from USD who were in charge of the oral program came from well-known oral schools, Clarke School for the Deaf and Lexington School for the Deaf. Officially offering an oral/aural communication style dramatically changed the philosophy of USD (UAD Bulletin, ?? Need to find that ref).</p>
		<p>Nowhere was this more dramatically seen than in its need for oral teachers. Since the teacher preparation program was formed, the controversy between oral and simultaneous communication broke out. [PHOTO]</p>
		<p>The philosophy of this program for prospective teachers was oral, and they were proponents of mainstreaming. Their influence was strong due to the fact that most parents of deaf children who supported the philosophy were hearing persons (Campbell, 1977). Because 90% of deaf children have hearing parents, most parents at that time, wanting their children to learn to talk in order to fully assimilate and function in the society at large, were hearing proponents of the movement (Baldwin, 1975, p. 1 and others). They were not familiar with sign language. Most of the adult Deaf community, on the other hand, supported the simultaneous communication. The Deaf community felt the simultaneous communication pedagogy should also be included in the teacher preparation program (Campbell, 1977).</p>
		<p>At this time, problems of the deaf education system were not limited to Utah but were common nationwide. Due to philosophical differences between educational and communication methods, the controversy occurred within the deaf educational system over the years. The controversy between oral and simultaneous communication was nationwide, but perhaps was more heated in Utah because of the oral training program being implemented in the teacher preparation program (Campbell, 1977).</p>
		<h3>Dr. Grant Bunderson Bitter</h3>
			<p>Dr. Grant Bunderson Bitter received his bachelor’s degree from the University of Utah in 1949. He taught in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Church Seminary Program from 1950 to 1958, and worked with the Salt Lake City Extension Classes for the Deaf from the fall of 1962 to 1964.</p>
			<p>In 1962, Dr. Bitter received a Special Education Certificate to teach children who were deaf from the Lexington School for the Deaf (affiliated with Columbia University) in New York City. After receiving a doctorate degree in audiology and administration from Wayne State University, Dr. Bitter returned to Utah in the summer of 1967. In addition to Dr. Bitter’s role as curriculum instructor, he was also appointed the director of religious instruction for Utah-based Deaf children who belonged to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS). Travel, music, and drama were hobbies, which Dr. Bitter had been actively engaged with in his spare time. Also, he enjoyed tennis, softball, and swimming. Dr. Bitter held the Utah State Secondary Certificate and was a member of the Utah Education Association, the National Education Association, the Convention of American Instructors of the Deaf, the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf, and also held many other membership to allied fields. Dr. Bitter was a father of nine children and was married to the former Margorie Louise Beard. They resided in Salt Lake City, Utah (The Utah Eagle, October 1967). He passed away on July 1, 2000.</p>

		<h3>The Creation of The “Y” System</h3>
		<p>Since 1902, Utah School for the Deaf had been utilizing combined method until the fall of 1962. While Robert W. Tegeder was USD Superintendent, Dr. Grant Bitter, along with other parents advocating the oral communication method, formed the Utah Council for the Deaf. They were successful in pushing through a policy within USD that shifted from a sign language approach to an oral/aural approach (UAD Bulletin, Fall-Winter, 1962). During that year, the Special Study Committee on the Education of the Deaf was formed and approved the Ogden campus of the Utah School for the Deaf to divide its school program into two channels after the students have completed the Primary Department, known as Dual Track Program (Wight, Ogden Standard-Examiner, October, 19, 1970).</p>
		<p>When the Dual Track Program was initiated in August 1962, the philosophy of USD for prospective teachers changed to oral. Speech became the primary means of communication in the classroom for deaf students. The new policy was called a “Y” system, meaning that all children had to start in the oral program in the Primary Department. The USD felt the Dual Track Program provided certain advantages that a single track cannot offer. Parents were able to select the type of education for their child that will best meet his/her total needs. In 1968, the USD was one of the very few residential schools that offered an entirely oral program (The Utah Eagle, February 1968).</p>
		<p>The academic program at this level was divided into two channels. One channel was the Simultaneous Communication Division, carrying out instruction via the manual alphabet, signs, speech, and speech reading. The other channel presented an oral atmosphere of speech and speech reading plus amplified sound. The Oral Division must be “pure oral” in philosophy (The Utah Eagle, February 1968). Most students continued oral instruction and other student used the simultaneous method. It was the beginning of the segregation.</p>
		<p>In the Primary Department, a deaf child was initially trained through the oral approach with exclusive use of speech, speech reading and amplified sound during his/her first six years of schooling (The Utah Eagle, February 1968). After six years in the residential school at Ogden, a committee took place to determine whether or not to continue the oral program or transfer to the communication simultaneous program based on school performance, test results and other factors (The Utah Eagle, February 1968; Wight, Ogden Standard-Examiner, October, 19, 1970).</p>
		<p>The extension program in the Salt Lake area was nearly as large the school itself, the program was entirely oral (Ogden Standard-Examiner, October, 19, 1970). If parents did not wish their child to pursue an exclusively oral education, they may elect to have him/her trained in the Simultaneous Communication Division after his/her sixth year in school (The Utah Eagle, February 1968). Ironically, those who pushed for the dual track system were from the Salt Lake area, and it greatly influenced and impacted on the residential school in Ogden.</p>
		<p>Teachers were required to be certified and complete a bachelor’s degree in the education of the deaf by accredited teacher center, including the University of Utah. Additionally, teachers in the Oral Division were required to have a background of training in oral education of the deaf. Simultaneous Communication teachers must have preparation in sign language and finger spelling (The Utah Eagle, February 1968). While the University of Utah served the oral division, Gallaudet College served as a source of information and as a guide under the simultaneous division, (The Utah Eagle, February 1968).</p>
		<p>By 1973, USD was the only state in the United States to have both methods of communication in the Dual Track system offered to its parents and students (Laflamme, Ogden Standard-Examiner, September 5, 1973). [PHOTO]</p>

			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>Two well-known Utah families who advocated for oral educational methods were the Osmonds and Winegars. The oldest children of George and Olive Osmond, George Virl, Jr. (Virl) and Thomas (Tom) Rulon were deaf. Keith Winegar, owner of the Winegar's Supermarkets Inc. based in Bountiful, Utah, was also the father of a deaf child.</p>
		</aside>
		<h3>The 1962 Student Protest</h3>
		<p>By the time, the Utah State Board of Education approved the Dual Track Program in 1962, the Ogden campus was divided, with each Oral and Simultaneous Communication Division having its own separate classrooms, dormitory facilities, recess, and co-curricular activities, except athletic programs (The Utah Eagle, February 1968; Ogden Standard-Examiner, October, 19, 1970). Because each division was not large enough to provide athletic programs, it was necessary to combine them in competitive sports (The Utah Eagle, February 1968).</p>
		<p>The students however were not aware of the reform until the first day of school (Diane Williams, personal communication, 2007). The result of this shift created an intense protest among the older USD students as well as controversy between veteran teachers and the Deaf community. More than half the high school students held a spontaneous protest on USD-Ogden campus (Jeff Pollock, personal communication, May 4, 2005). The initiation of the movement against the reform was the idea of then-USD-student Johnny Murray. Murray remembered that, in the weeks before school started that year, Tony Christopulos, Utah School for the Deaf principal and oral advocate, stopped by his parents’ home asking to see if they would like to place him in the oral program. Soon after Tony left, the Murrays asked Johnny if he would be interested in enrolling in the oral program. He said, “No.” They respected his decision. At that time, he did not understand what was going on until school started (Johnny Murray, personal communication, August 14, 2009; Ronald Burdett, personal communication, 2007).</p>
		<p>Based on parental preference, the students were “forced” to be separated into the Oral and Simultaneous Communication Divisions. The “wall” was formed where the students were not allowed to interact with each other. In one example, high school sweethearts were unexpectedly placed in separate programs, and were forbidden to see each other on school campus. Not only that, when the dual program was being established, the students feared they would lose their long-time well-respected deaf teachers, Donald Jensen, Jerry Taylor, Kenneth C. Burdett, father of Ronald Burdett, USD sophomore and Dora B. Laramie, mother of Celia Mae Baldwin, also USD sophomore (Johnny Murray, personal communication, August 14, 2009; Kenneth L. Kinner, personal communication, May 14, 2011). [PHOTO]</p>
		<p>Johnny Murray, a senior class and also president of Student Council became a leader to lead the protest along with most of the seniors, juniors, and sophomores (there was no freshman class in Ogden at this time). Those 25 students were members of a Simultaneous Communication Program (Ogden Standard Examiner, September 14, 1962). For a week, Johnny and students worked together to write posters with shoe polish and used wood sticks to hold them. USD teachers, especially the four deaf teachers, Kenneth Burdett, Donald Jensen, Dora Laramie, and Jerry Taylor, were unaware of their plan to strike (Nellie Sausedo, personal communication, 2007).</p>
		<p>After a week of secret preparations, on Friday, September 14th at 8:30 am, after attending their seminary class at the LDS Church Deaf Branch building, Johnny and others students refused to attend classes. They appeared in the doorways of their classrooms for a moment and then left (Ogden Standard Examiner, September 14, 1962). They arrived at the old gym where they held the posters and marched into the USD campus. During the strike, Ron spotted his father, Kenneth C. Burdett standing off to the side. He smiled a little because he understood the reason for their objections although he couldn’t do anything about it due his teaching protection (Ronald Burdett, personal communication, 2009). However, some hearing teachers were disgusted and astonished at the students. The teachers thought they were being silly for being on strike. One of the teachers, Thomas VanDrimmelen was so upset that he attempted pull Celia May (Laramie) Baldwin out of the march. Her mother, Dora B. Laramie ran and stopped him yelling, “Don’t touch C.M.!” “Let her go!” (Nellie Sausedo, personal communication, 2007). Some of the students carried placards asking for interviews with the State Board of Education (Ogden Standard Examiner, September 14, 1962).</p>
		<p>Although the school and teachers were unaware of the students’ whereabouts (Ogden Standard Examiner, September 14, 1962), the students had actually left campus and walked to nearby Lorin Farr Park. They hid behind trees while two teachers drove by looking for them. When the students couldn’t be found, they escaped to a movie theatre at around 10:00 AM, but it was closed. They went to the Burdett’s backyard to hang out. In the backyard, Johnny asked them, “How much money do we have?” After they chipped in their money, one went to the grocery store on 26th and Quincy Avenue to purchase cookies and punch for their “lunch time” (Nellie Sausedo, personal communication, 2007; Ronald Burdett, personal communication, 2007). By this time, Kenneth C. Burdett returned home from work and was astonished to find the students at his home. Because he was concerned about their safety, he quickly brought them back to USD. The students then went home for the weekend (Ronald Burdett, personal communication, 2007).</p>
		<p>The following Monday, Johnny and other students were called to meet with Superintendent Tegeder in his office. He asked them, “Why did you go on strike?” Instead of answering his question, they asked, “Why do we have two departments on the school campus?” “Why does the Oral Department have more students than the Simultaneous Communication Department? He, at this time supported the oral philosophy said, “Oh well!” They expressed their deep distress and disappointment with the reform of the oral and simultaneous communication students being separated in their dormitories, dining rooms, physical education classes, cooking classes, sewing classes, printing classes, workshop classes, and different events. They missed the old way, especially their friends. The students were protesting the conditions and restrictions on their signing which they felt had become intolerable. No one listened to them (Nellie Sausedo, personal communication, 2007).</p>
<p>During the rally, Christopulos reported he thought the outcray may have been the result of some “parent influence.” In accordance to the newspaper article, while 52 other students of the same age group were enrolled at the Oral Program, the smaller group was apparent “dissatisfied” because they wanted all students to be together (Ogden Standard Examiner, September 14, 1962).</p>
		<h3>The Impact of the “Y” System</h3>
		<p>Despite the protest, the “Y” system was officially established in Ogden where the residential school was located as well as in schools in a district in the Salt Lake area. This new policy required all deaf and hard of hearing children to begin in the oral program at age three. There were no other options for parents to choose. If the oral component failed, deaf children could be transferred to the simultaneous communications program, generally at the age of 10-12 years (First Reunion of the Utah School for the Deaf Alumni, 1976). Additionally, when the children reached to the required ages, the parents could decide to branch them out into one of two programs. This division of communication departments, i.e. the oral and simultaneous, was known as a dual program (Kenneth L. Kinner, personal communication, May 14, 2011).</p>
		<h4>Parents’ Educational Choices Limited</h4>
		<p>Salt Lake-area families preferring simultaneous communication would have to send their older deaf child to a simultaneous communication program at residential school in Ogden or pull their children out of USD and enroll them in a public school with and without a sign language interpreter (some requests were denied). The educational placement options were severely limited in that area (Kenneth L. Kinner, personal communication, May 14, 2011).</p>
		<p>Shortly after the “Y” system and the dual program were in effect and protest was over, Tony Christopulos, a graduate of Lexington School for the Deaf and Columbia University called older deaf students into the classroom and wrote down both Deaf World and Hearing World on the black board. He emphasized them that they should not go to the Deaf World. He made an X on the Deaf World and then circled the Hearing World. He again emphasized that they must go to the hearing world (Robert W. Tegeder, The Utah Eagle, April 1959; Ronald Burdett, personal communication, 2007).</p>
		<p>Kenneth C. Burdett (USD, ’29) and a long time teacher, was appointed as a Curriculum Coordinator of the Simultaneous Communication Program under the direction of Tony Christopulus with J. Boyd Neilsen as a Curriculum Director of the Oral Division at the USD campus.</p>
		<h3>The Increase of Students with Multiple Disabilities</h3>
		<p>At the time, the percentage of deaf students with multiple disabilities was increasing. The residential school in Ogden was eventually taken over by these students. The deaf children with normal minds and normal capabilities were pushed into oral day schools, the philosophy being that oral skills needed to be drilled early in life to determine if the child had any talent in these areas. However when the elementary and middle school years were taken up with these oral skills and it was discovered the student did not have the ability to perform these skills, the students were shunted to the signing program. The oral advocates were not willing to accept responsibility for the many failures among the deaf students (The UAD Bulletin, Spring 1965). As a result, the students lost out on those early years of language acquisition which the brain is naturally wired for. There was a belief held among the oral educators that it wasn't too late. A teen can acquire sign language during high school. The oral proponents used this argument so their carefully nurtured public image would not be damaged. However, this argument is faulty because there is a big difference between gaining language proficiency and learning how to 'small talk'. These students who were "oral failures" certainly did learn to sign in high school but never achieved their academic potential. And no one was willing to figure out why.</p>
		<p>The past shows the trend where intelligent students were pushed through the oral program in order to focus on speech and hearing skills. This was done, many times, at the expense of their academic education. Then, usually after it was too late for them to realize much benefit, the students who didn't do well were shunted into the signing program. Maintaining this type of mindset and educational philosophy will only cause our deaf students to continue to fail because their language acquisition years have passed without any real confirmation of their language needs.</p>
		<p>Kenneth C. Burdett, however, through the “Y” system, was unable to promote the curriculum to achieve their highest academic potential because the more promising students were initially placed in the oral program. He struggled to serve those who failed the oral program. By the time, they reached to their required age; their achievement in education fell below due to the lack of early acquisition of language exposure. They in most cases grew up with minimal exposure to any form of language. He worked hard to fill in a gap by assisting delayed students to learn the English language. He also had to serve a number of students with multiple disabilities (Ronald Burdett, personal communication, 2009).</p>
		<p>Oral advocates suspected that the UAD was behind the plan for the 1962 student protest. The Utah State Board of Education investigated but failed to find a connection between the students and the UAD (Sanderson, UAD Bulletin, Summer 1963). Dr. Robert G. Sanderson, UAD president (1960-63), denied having to do with it and stated that the strike was spontaneous – a reaction of the students against conditions, restrictions, and personalities, which they felt, had become intolerable (7). It constituted a dark chapter in the education of the deaf in Utah.</p>

		<h1>Did you know?</h1>
		<p>When the Utah School for the Deaf instituted the “Y” System, it caused students like Rosa Marie Rathbun and many other deaf students to have the traumatic experience of being separating from their classmates and friends. They didn’t understand what the school was doing. She thought they set up groups, depending on how good or stupid they were. Rosa wished the Deaf Mentor Program existed years ago. She believed that if a Deaf Mentor Program had existed during those troubling years, it would have eased so much of the pain and frustration. Since Rosa pursued this career of Deaf Mentor in October 1993, she realized more and more how much the parents need guidance and support in order to be at ease with their deaf children as well as to be able to communicate with their children at a very young age. She felt this experience as a Deaf Mentor had been very rewarding and fulfilling for her (Rathbum, UAD Bulletin, December 1994).</p>

			<p>As the focus of education at the Utah School for the Deaf rapidly began to change, well-educated Deaf parents like Kenneth C. Burdett and Dora B. Laramie continued to have high expectations for their children. Ronald Burdett and Celia May (Laramie) Baldwin passed their exit exams and departed for Gallaudet College in 1965. In 1970, after completed master’s degrees at other universities, they both became well-known and successful in their respective careers.</p>

		<h3>The Utah Association of the Deaf Meets With State Superintendent Allen E. Bateman of Public Instruction</h3>
		<p>For the first time the oral method would be offered on the USD campus along with simultaneous communication, as the instructional signing was officially called. Speech would become the primary means of communication in the oral/aural classrooms for deaf students. This would begin for the 1962-63 school term.</p>
		<p>Philosophical differences between the two main communication methods in use at USD namely oral/aural communication and simultaneous communication became evident. UAD officers Dr. Robert G. Sanderson, G. Leon Curtis, Ned C. Wheeler, Robert L. Welsh, Joseph B. Burnett, Kenneth L. Kinner, and Gladys (Burnham) Wenger tried to intervene and counter the shift to oral/aural at the expense of signing. They met with State Superintendent Dr. Allen E. Bateman of Public Instruction without success.</p>
		<p>Through Gladys Wenger who acted as an interpreter, they expressed their concerns about the “Y” system and dual program. They felt the signing environment on campus should remain unchanged. However, Dr. Bateman showed a pile of letters from parents of deaf children to the UAD officers and picked one letter expressing a desire to place a deaf child in an oral program. In spite of parents’ wishes, there was not much officers could do about this situation.</p>
		<p>Apparently, the Utah School for the Deaf teachers who advocated an oral/aural approach pushed the parents to write their letters to State Superintendent Bateman to make effective reforms. Little they knew it forever-impacts on controversy over the educational philosophies and communication methodologies (Kenneth L. Kinner, personal communication, May 14, 2011).</p>

			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>During the 2005 Utah School for the Deaf Reunion in the gym at the Sanderson Community Center of Deaf and Hard of Hearing, Ronald Burdett and Celia May Baldwin briefly shared with the alumni about the 1962 Student Protest. Duane Harrison, a retired hearing USD teacher, happened to be present when Burdett announced that Johnny Murray was the leader of the demonstratoin. After all those years of teachers wondering who started the rally and the students for refusing to share the information with the USD staff members, Harrison said, “Now I know who started the strike” (Johnny Murray, personal communication, September 2007).</p>
		</aside>
		<h3>An Oral Philosophy Impacts Movement</h3>
		<p>This change in teaching of prospective teachers had a definite impact on USD and its future educational philosophy. The majority of faculty members were orally-trained and were hired to serve in the oral program. As a result, the oral mode of instruction became the primary method of teaching in the USD residential setting and extension programs, upsetting professionals and families who favored sign language.</p>
		<p>USD felt that a student’s success in attaining intelligible speech and adequate language depended on developing a solid foundation at the beginning of year. Thus, USD employed the oral mode of instruction as early as possible. In 1963, the program received a “commendable” review by the Conference of Executives of American Schools for the Deaf (Survey of Program for Preparation of Teachers of the Deaf at the University of Utah, 1963), a time when oralism had a stranglehold on education of deaf children in the United States.</p>
		<p>Over the years, speech and language development continued to occupy the major part of the academic program. Auditory training was also a very important aspect of USD, which was heavily emphasized under the oral program. For many years, the ideas of “pure” oralism began to spread, and the philosophy that the Deaf could be taught to speak and lip-reading began to take root among many oral advocates in Utah. With the assistant of the University of Utah, they had produced teachers that had come to USD and extension division, which served children basically on a statewide basis (Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz, personal communication, 2007; Bronwyn O’Hara, personal communication, 2009).</p>

			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>Dr. Grant B. Bitter reported in his Summary of Tenure Report in 1985 that his teacher training-oral program was very respected program both nationally and internationally. Since its inception in 1962, there had been approximately 145 candidates for the job market. It was a small program compared to some, but they were concerned with quality. The average was from 5-7 graduates per years.</p>
			<p>Dr. Bitter further reported that approximately a third of the teaching/supervisory personnel of the Utah School for the Deaf, and many in Utah school districts are graduates of the University of Utah. Outside of Utah, they were employed in over 25 states, and internationally had taught or were teaching in Africa, Australia, Canada, Finland, Japan, Mexico, and Okinawa (A Summary Report for Tenure, 1985).</p>

		<h3>Utah Council for the Deaf</h3>
		<p>In October 1962, several parents drew Utah Association of the Deaf’s attention to a parent who circulated a following letter entitled, “Utah Council for the Deaf” to parents of deaf children in Utah. UAD expressed concern about the letter causing severe damage to the Utah School for the Deaf, its administrators, teachers and students, the adult deaf people of Utah, and the children.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>UTAH COUNCIL FOR THE DEAF</p>
			<p>After several years of work, the Utah School for the Deaf finally inaugurated this year a dual program which gives parents a choice as to the type of education their children are to receive at the school. For the first time, parents who chose the oral program have found their children in an oral environment not only in the classrooms but in the dormitories, playgrounds, and dining rooms.</p>
			<p>The staff has made a sincere effort to encourage oral communication at all times.</p>
			<p>As a parent who has indicated an interest in having your child receives a strong oral program, we are sure that you are alarmed at recent events which have transpired at the Utah School for the Deaf in Ogden.</p>
			<p>It is apparent that certain individuals in the adult deaf groups, and some of the older group of students who are long time trouble makers in the non-oral department at the school have dedicated themselves to killing this program before it has a chance to prove its merits. To many parents who are somewhat undecided, they have made an aggressive campaign in order to cloud the issues. They make no attempt to hide their plan to foment disunity at the school, and press for dismissal of the administrators and some school personnel who are trying to help us with the program.</p>
			<p>From information we have obtained, it is clear that they intend to make it impossible for Riley School to develop its present program.</p>
			<p>If there is a change of administration at the State School, there is serious doubt whether any orally trained or inclined replacement teachers would be willing to come into a state where the education of the deaf is in the hands of a few antagonistic deaf alumni and a few disgruntled parents.</p>
			<p>Through control of hiring replacement teachers, an unsympathetic administration would be able to destroy the program without coming into the open.</p>
			<p>After having planned and put into operation the present fine program, we will not willingly nor quietly lose what we have put forth so much effort to accomplish.</p>
			<p>The State Board of Education is being subjected to tremendous pressure from the adult deaf. One board member wants to eliminate our seriously hamper efforts to maintain the oral department at the State School for the Deaf. He has made no secret of his dislike for the day school program in Salk Lake City and any further expansion in oral education.</p>
			<p>If we are to save the present oral program, it is imperative that you make your feelings known individually to the following board members:</p>
			<p>(Names and addresses of nine board members, plus Dr. Marion G. Merkeley and Dr. Marsden B. Stokes are listed).</p>
			<p>It may be necessary for us to appear in person before the board to demand that the adults deaf terminate entirely their efforts to control and administer the education program of our children in the Utah Schools and that the administration be left in the hands of those trained and hired for that job.</p>
			<p>Trained oral teachers and administrators will not and cannot remain in our schools when they are subjected to continual harassment, personal attack, and degradation.</p>
			<p>Once again, we are fighting for the survival of the present program. Write your letter now!</p>
			<p>Sincerely yours,<br>Utah Council of the Deaf</p>
			<p>(UAD Bulletin, Fall-Winter, 1962, p. 3).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>UAD mailed the copies to the Utah State Board of Education and the state superintendent of public instruction. UAD felt it was unnecessary to make points to the letter; the board was aware of all facts. However, because some parents had expressed concern over the situation, UAD decided to publish an article on the UAD Bulletin in the Fall-Winter 1962 to set the record straight. UAD felt the Utah Council for the Deaf was being paranoid from receiving biased information.</p>
		<p>UAD pointed out that the Utah Council for the Deaf was not for the deaf because no deaf persons had served on it. UAD professed concern over conditions at the apparently not one of the officers listed has a child at the school in Ogden (Some had children at the Riley Extension).</p>
		<p>UAD clarified that they supported a fair test of the “two-track” or dual program at the Utah School for the Deaf as a classroom matter. However, they expressed strong disapproval of the attempt at complete social segregation, interference with religious activities, the crippling of the sports program and the severe pressure to the children in the oral department to enforce the “no signing.”</p>
		<p>UAD defended that the segregation was raised by the students themselves, some of whom the council’s false statement about the “long-time trouble makers.” UAD explained that the deaf adults with higher education were simply trying to share the education issues with parents who were unaware of them. UAD then emphasized that parents who tried to voice doubts about council’s theories were dismissed.</p>
		<p>UAD was astonished to learn that the State Board of Education was subjected to “tremendous pressure” from the adult deaf. The letter claims, “From information we have obtained, it is clear that they intend to make it impossible for Riley School to develop its present program.” UAD hadn’t had slightest idea of what Riley’s program could be, other than to continue as an oral day school. UAD felt certain that the information was incorrect. UAD explained that the adult deaf of Utah – meaning the UAD – did not oppose Riley, nor any other school for the deaf that is adequately staffed by trained teachers of the deaf. UAD opposed any day school for the deaf that is lacking in proper staff, grade progression, vocational training opportunities and social activities. UAD recorded that far too many of the day school were so lacking, and as a consequence were turning out a generation of welfare recipients. They just hoped it would not happen at Riley.</p>
		<p>UAD was stunned by the remark that “Trained oral teachers and administrators will not and cannot remain in our schools when they are subjected to continual harassment, personal attack and degradation.” UAD knew a number of teachers who taught sign language also experienced much petty persecution.</p>
		<p>Lastly, UAD was slightly strike by the dictatorial paragraph suggesting the need for parents to “demand that the adult deaf terminate entirely their efforts to control and administer the education program of our children...” UAD clarified that the State Board of Education controlled and administered the education program and that Superintendent Robert W. Tegeder was charged with direction of the School for the Deaf in Ogden. UAD asserted their rights to voice their opinions openly and publicly. Some of the members were parents of deaf children and had as much right to speak up as anyone else (UAD Bulletin, Fall-Winter 1962, p. 2-3).</p>
		<h3>Dr. Robert G. Sanderson Responds to a Parent’s Letter</h3>
		<p>In order to acknowledge the background controversy between oral advocating parents and Utah Association of the Deaf, on April 25, 1963, a parent, D’On Reese of an oral deaf son felt threatened by Utah Association of the Deaf for trying to get rid of oralism. She wrote a following letter to Dr. Robert Sanderson, UAD President, which was publicly published on the UAD Bulletin, Summer 1963.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Dear Mr. Sanderson:</p>
			<p>I really enjoy reading your UAD Bulletin. I’ve never seen so much nonsense put together. It really makes for funny reading.</p>
			<p>Why don’t you put your time to good use, instead of just trying to find ways of get rid of oralism?</p>
			<p>I have a son in the oral department of the Utah School for the Deaf. And I have not heard one parent that has a child in that school, say anything against oralism. It’s just you adult deaf.</p>
			<p>I don’t know what satisfaction it gives you to try to stop oralsim. As long as I’m alive, (I’m a lot younger than you) you’ll have me to fight, if you expect to get rid of oralism.</p>
			<p>The only time that I feel bad about my son being deaf, is for fear he might met up with ignorant people like you.</p>
			<p>When you wrote to Dr. Greenaway at the Yorkshire School for the Deaf, did you inform him that the parents at our school are perfectly satisfied with what they have?</p>
			<p>Did you tell him that it’s just you meddling outsiders, that are afraid that our children might be getting something better than you did, that are upset?</p>
			<p>Did you tell him that you went to the school board members last fall, and tried to stop our oral program?</p>
			<p>Did you tell him that you got a hold of our students last fall and stated a walk out to get rid of oralism?</p>
			<p>Did you tell him that you circulated a letter to our legislators, to try and get our budget for the school cut so that we can’t have qualified teachers?</p>
			<p>Where has all of this gotten you?</p>
			<p>Our oral department is still there, and I think it will be there after you’re long gone.</p>
			<p>Do you see us oral parents going around trying to chop your fingers off, so you can’t sign?</p>
			<p>I’m perfectly willing to let the simultaneous dept. stay at our school.</p>
			<p>Those people who are too lazy to learn to talk need it.</p>
			<p>We’re not bothering you so why don’t you leave us alone?</p>
			<p>We are the ones that brought these deaf children into the world. We are the ones who have stayed awake at nights trying to decide what’s best for them. We’ve looked at both sides of the ways to teach our children, and we have come to the conclusion that oralsim is best.</p>
			<p>Are you willing for me to tell you how to educate your hearing children? According to you I have every right to, because I can hear and you can’t. We have a wonderful administration at our school, and very good teachers. Now if you’ll just leave them and our children alone, we’ll be most grateful.</p>
			<p>When we need your help, we’ll ask for it.</p>
			<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
			<p>D’On Reese<br>Smithfield<br>R.F.D. #1 Utah</p>
			<p>(UAD Bulletin, Summer 1963, p. 2 &#38; 14)</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Dr. Robert G. Sanderson responded to Reese’s letter on April 30, 1963 sharing his perspective of UAD’s privilege to voice concerns, explaining the inadequate deaf educational system, appreciating D’On Reese’s position as a parent, and elaborating the situation with the student strike at Utah School for the Deaf in September 1962.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Mrs. D’On Reese<br>RFD No. 1<br>Smithfield, Utah</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. Reese:</p>
			<p>Thank you very much for your letter of April 25. As you requested, we shall publish it in full, verbatim.</p>
			<p>The UAD welcomes expressions of opinions from parents, teachers, professional educators, and individuals of every philosophy. The pages of the UAD Bulletin are always open to those who wish to be heard.</p>
			<p>Membership in the Association entitles one to attend meetings, propose and discuss policies, and actions. Where a majority of the membership does not agree with the policies and actions of the officers, they may exercise the American right of “voting them out” at regularly scheduled elections. We would welcome your attendance at our forthcoming convention, and would give you and any other parent an opportunity to be heard at the proper time and improper order; the same privileges are extended to all registered members.</p>
			<p>Contrary to the belief or oralists that the adult deaf oppose oral instruction, we certainly do not. It has its place in the curriculum, for those who can benefit from it, along with reading, writing, arithmetic, history, geography, science, and all of the other subjects school must teach. What the adult deaf do oppose is disproportionate attention to speech and lip-reading aspects, to the extent that the assimilation of subject matter becomes so difficult and so delayed that the total education of the deaf child suffers.</p>
			<p>We adult deaf are interested in seeing deaf children acquire the best possible education as well as seeing them learn to speak. As we have learned in our personal lives, covering in the aggregate hundreds of years of experience in coping with the multitudinous socio-economic problems of deafness on a day-to-day basis, speech and lip-reading, while useful, solve no basic problems. The quality and the amount of education received, academically and vocationally, are what count.</p>
			<p>I sincerely hope that your deaf son can profit by total oralism. Some children can, and some cannot, and any professional educator, if he is honest, will tell you so. If it should become apparent to you that your boy’s progress is not what it should be or what you expect, or that his happiness (which is so close to your heart) is at stake, then perhaps your love form him would suggest another approach – one that guarantees to him an immediate means of expressing himself. The satisfaction of early and full self expression cannot be overestimated in its value to a well-adjusted child.</p>
			<p>It should be remembered that we deaf adults had parents of many of whom once felt as you do, so we understand and appreciate your position.</p>
			<p>Where the official position of the Association is concerned, I would suggest that you ascertain the facts with reference to other matters you mention in your letter. However, any member of our association, regardless of his office, may act individually as his conscience so dictates since he is also a taxpayer with those certain rights and privileges we value here in America. If any of our members choose to petition legislators against further spending on education, building, or any other phase of government and has his reasons, he is a free agent. His personal stand is not necessarily that of the association.</p>
			<p>I must deny, publicly and categorically, in the strongest possible terms, that the Utah Association for the Deaf had anything to do with the student strike at the school last fall.</p>
			<p>The strike was spontaneous – a reaction of the students against conditions, restrictions, and personalities, which they felt, had become intolerable. The State Board of Education investigated and failed to turn up any connection between the students and the UAD. Severe pressures brought to hear on student leaders also failed to establish any connection. There was one coincidence: A member of our association happened to be at the school on a business matter (verifiable), and out of this coincidence some rather wild rumors grew.</p>
			<p>I HONESTLY believe that the adult deaf and parents of deaf children should work together closely toward the better education of deaf children. Working at cross-purposes merely ensures continuing and futile disputes.</p>
			<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
			<p>Robert G. Sanderson<br>President</p>
			<p>(UAD Bulletin, Summer 1963, p. 14)</p>

		<h1>Did you know?</h1>
		<p>When the Deaf visitors from out of state are informed about the Dual Program offered at the Utah School for the Deaf, they often react in disbelief and asked why the oral program was not administered by the school district instead of by the state; after all, if the parents want their children to be 100% like themselves, their deaf children should be placed in public schools without any support from the state (UAD Bulletin, February 1996).</p>

		<h3>The A.G. Bell Association Forms an Oral Deaf Adult Section at the 1964 Biennial Meeting in Salt Lake City, Utah</h3>
		<p>During the biennial meeting in June 1964 held in Salt Lake City, the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf inaugurated an Oral Deaf Section.</p>
		<p>Utah became the first state to found the Oral Deaf Section in 1964 to carry out the mission of Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf encouraging, helping and inspiring all concerned with deafness so that deaf children and adults may improve their educational, vocational, and social opportunities in the hearing world through cultivation of their speech, speech-reading and residual hearing.</p>
		<p>The new section was formed by oral deaf adults outside of Utah. They were Dr. H. Latham Breunig, who was elected chairman, Dr. James C. Marsters, the convention’s keynote speaker, Dr. Richard Thompson, and H. William Bernstein. It was for adults who are deaf or hard of hearing and choose to communicate through spoken language and speech reading.</p>
		<p>One of the sessions of the Bell Association meeting was to provide a panel discussion by six oral deaf people who told their stories and discussed their problems to a large appreciative audience. Parents attended the sessions and had opportunity to talk with deaf people during arranged luncheons.</p>
		<p>A younger brother of Afton (Curtis) Burdett, G. Leon Curtis, president of Utah Association for the Deaf, along with UAD members, Eugene Petersen, Dr. Robert G. Sanderson, and Ray Wenger, took their opportunity to talk to some of the oral deaf founders. Curtis explained in the UAD Bulletin, Summer 1964 that the oral deaf adults gave credit for their success in different fields to their oral education. They had a nice conversation. Some of their theories differed. The oral deaf adults seemed to have the impression that the UAD members were trying to hold deaf children back by teaching them the sign language, which was not the case. Curtis pointed out that there were outstandingly successful deaf people who received their education under the combined method, which supplements oral instruction with finger spelling and signs. Curtis then clarified that UAD believed that if a child can progress satisfactorily under pure oral instruction, there is no objection to sticking with this method. He, however basically explained that if a child does not progress well in the oral method, the fact should be faced candidly and promptly before it is too late (Utah Bulletin, Summer 1964, p. 2).</p>
		<h3>The Controversy Between Dr. Grant B. Bitter and Dr. Robert G. Sanderson</h3>
		<p>Due to the rapid growth of the oral movement and decline of sign language in the educational system in Utah, Dr. Robert G. Sanderson, a respected leader of the Deaf community, began to battle with Dr. Grant B. Bitter in 1965 to increase public awareness of the importance of preserving sign language and promoting quality of education for deaf children. It was challenging to battle with Dr. Bitter because he had the influence and leverage to promote oralism in deaf education. Hundreds of oral advocate parents were so agitated with Dr. Sanderson’s constant battle with Dr. Bitter that they demanded his boss have him fired. His boss was kind enough to let Dr. Sanderson keep his job where he had just started at the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation, despite his heavy political involvement outside of his employment (Dr. Robert G. Sanderson, personal communication, 2006).</p>
		<p>Although there were numerous ardent and enthusiastic advocates for the oral education of the deaf in the state of Utah, their level of enthusiasm were, however, not equal to Dr. Bitter. He strongly espoused hard-core oralism. He had an impact; he attacked residential schools and the popular use of sign language (Baldwin, 1990).</p>
		<p>Through the legislative process, Dr. Bitter made an effective, endless lobbying effort based on the need to better prepare deaf and hard of hearing students to live in the oral/aural English-speaking society, also known as the mainstream of “normal” daily living (Summary Report for Tenure, 1985; Baldwin, 1990). Similar to Alexander Graham Bell, the most influential oral advocate in America in 19th century, Dr. Bitter was determined to promote the full assimilation of deaf people into hearing society and was so committed to the perspective that deaf people should learn to talk (Baldwin, 1990).</p>
		<p>During Dr. Bitter’s tenure, he was involved in numerous commitments in both local state and national level. On a state level, he founded the Oral Deaf Association of Utah in 1970 and Utah Registry of Oral Interpreters in 1981. He chaired a committee on advocacy for oral deaf persons through the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf of Utah. Additionally, Dr. Bitter directed the teacher preparation program with an emphasis in Oral Deaf Education at the University of Utah from 1962 to 1987 (Summary Report for Tenure, 1985; Utah’s Hearing Impaired Children...At High Risk, 1986). On a national level, Dr. Bitter also worked with the oral interpreting by leading the workshops at the University of Cincinnati and University of Utah. He served on the committee to develop the Curriculum Guide for the Instruction of Oral Interpreting published by the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf. From 1974-1978, he served as chairman of the Governmental Relations Committee of the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf. During this time, he and his committee had direct contact and worked with the Utah Congressional Team, and in particular Orrin G. Hatch, United States Senator from Utah and Chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources committee. Senator Hatch participated with him in a video production for an international presentation at the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf convention in Portland, Oregon in June of 1983. From 1974-1978, he also served as president of the International Parents’ Organization of the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf (Summary Report for Tenure, 1985).</p>
		<p>Moreover, Dr. Bitter created numerous publication, audiovisual, and videotape materials on oral education. He published his book called “The Hearing Impaired: New Perspectives in Educational and Social Management in 1987 (Summary Report for Tenure, 1985; Utah’s Hearing Impaired Children...At High Risk, 1986).</p>
		<aside>
			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>Dr. Grant B. Bitter wrote his Summary Report for Tenure on March 15, 1985 for the Tenure Review Committee at the University of Utah. In his summary, he shared his experience struggling to decide what was best for his deaf daughter, Colleen in social, religion, and educational systems.</p>
			<p>Dr. Bitter stated that his daughter, Colleen was born with a profound hearing loss in 1955 and she was the fourth child in his family of nine children. At the time of her birth, he had left public education as an English teacher and assistant administrator in a junior high school to become an instructor in the religious educational system of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. When his daughter, Colleen was two-and-a-half years of age, her hearing loss was detected. Dr. Bitter and his wife began searching for answers and help. Thirty years ago, there wasn’t much professional and family support available. They began to urgent search for meaningful educational and social programs for deaf children. It was found that they would have to create and build them along with other professionals and parents who were struggling with common concerns and issues.</p>
			<p>Dr. Bitter further shared his initial experiences/relationships with some professionals in the field were not always productive. He said he became a vigorous parent/family advocate for rights and options and professional integrity. Hence, his work in the area of deaf had been directed toward responsible family and professional relationships. This motivated him to give presentations, create publications, and conduct workshops.</p>
			<p>He also shared his philosophy that advocacy included the rights of deaf individuals to live productively, free from intimidation and discrimination in educational programming, the job market, religious and social environments. He said he utilized his expertise in the field of Deaf education in most of his conferences, workshops, classes, and other activities.</p>
			<p>Dr. Bitter acknowledged the history of the school for the deaf in the nation. He shared his experience with inadequate intervention strategies, inappropriate educational placement and programming. He and his wife were made painfully aware of the extend of human inadequacies in dealing with disabilities. He observed the audiological, educational, medical, technological interventions were hardly beginning to surface at that time. He said the institutionalization was yet the most common and recommended placement for deaf children/youth. It confined them to a very restrictive environment.</p>
			<p>He shared his historical perspectives that the founding of the first school for the deaf in Hartford, Connecticut in 1817 isolated human beings from a dynamic learning environment that left them deaf and mute in a silent world. Further, he said that sub cultural deaf organizations were naturally created from among the deaf individuals and their families in America. The National Association of the Deaf was a vigorous champion of sign language as are the state groups with the support of public residential schools for the deaf. All used a variety of sign language modalities as their primary modes of communication in educational programs. He said because sign language users and advocates formed a strong alliance against spoken language proponents, that had plagued them for centuries. Many parents and educators who were convinced of the value of spoken language modalities (oral, aural/oral persuasions) created private schools where they would not have to be intimidated by sign language persuasions. He commented that although some excellent private schools emerged, many parents wanted their deaf children to remain at home in programs where they could have a choice of communication modes.</p>
			<p>While Dr. Bitter was struggling and experiencing educational chaos, he and his family were searching for answers regarding the appropriate placement for Colleen. He said, with “religious ferver: some people advised them to teach her sign language. “Deafness was her heritage.” To learn to talk was impossible and would be denying her deafness.” He said it was a persuasive argument.</p>
			<p>Dr. Bitter shared that with a large family it would have been rather easy to turn Colleen’s educational, religious, and social training to the Deaf community and their advocates. They knew that it would not be simple to devote the energy and time to appropriate educational programming for her because they were novices, and yet not convinced that institutional placement was proper. Further, he explained that they were not persuaded either that the “beautiful language of signs” was all the productive. Colleen was a member of a very large talkative family, and they wanted her to be able to enjoy the beauty and advantages of spoken language. Isolation, and the thoughts of a “deaf world” provided no incentive nor intrigue for them. They were appalled at the apparent lack of professional support for parents in time of crisis. They were shocked by cruel judgments vented on parents by not only professionals who “knew all the answers,” but also by some religious leaders and teachers who ascribed the causes of disabilities to the supernatural, and that they (disabilities) were meant to be by a loving and kind God.</p>
			<p>Dr. Bitter and his family concluded that not only did many professionals need to reevaluate human values and professionalism, but that religious leaders and teachers also needed to rethink on human values in their search for truth in bringing dignity to all human beings, he said. Dr. Bitter also said they found themselves dealing with some of the same problems that faced Hippocrates centuries ago.</p>
			<p>Lastly, Dr. Bitter said because of the reasons stated in his report, his time and energy was on the “front line” of human activity (A Summary Report for Tenure, 1985).</p>

		<h3>Controversy at Parent Teacher Association Function</h3>
		<p>In 1969-1970, parents of deaf children were actively involved in the Utah School for the Deaf Parent-Teacher Association in Ogden, Utah. Linda C. Harrop, a hearing parent was the PTA president. She, along with most hearing parents was an oral proponent. Other parents, along with Kenneth L. Kinner, PTA Vice-President, were proponents of the simultaneous communication. There was heated controversy between oral and simultaneous communication at PTA functions. At that time, deaf parents were not allowed to sit at the front row. They were asked to sit in the back row with a sign language interpreter so sign would not be seen or exposed to others, particularly to the young children who were oral. Additionally, both deaf and hearing parents who favored simultaneous communication were not able to voice as it was oppressed; they were unable to voice their concerns about education issues. Deaf parents were not the only ones who had to deal with these barriers. Oral deaf children were covered by their parent’s coats so sign language wouldn’t be seen at the PTA meetings (Dr. Jay J. Campbell, personal communication, July 1, 2007; Kenneth L. Kinner, personal communication, May 14, 2011).</p>
		<h3>A New Curriculum Coordinator For The Extension Division</h3>
		<p>In 1969, Dr. Grant B. Bitter felt he was not able to serve as a full time curriculum coordinator on a full time basis of the Extension Division School for the Deaf in Salt Lake City. He had two other jobs as a director of the Teacher Training Program at the University of Utah and as a coordinator of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Seminary Program for deaf children. Dr. Bitter was replaced by Charles Peters, another oral advocate (UAD Bulletin, Summer 1969).</p>
		<h3>The 1969 Student Walkout Strike</h3>
		<p>Since the Dual Track Program was implemented at the Utah School for the Deaf in 1962, the system became quite complex. It required endless hours of difficult and exacting work. The complete cooperation of both teachers and administrative personal was essential. Additionally, parents, teachers, and administrative personnel must believe wholeheartedly in a Dual Track Program. The parents must be fully cooperative of this program (The Utah Eagle, February 1968).</p>
		<p>Since 1962, oral and simultaneous communication students had been forbidden to interact on school campus in Ogden, Utah. They continued to live in separate dormitories, even eating in the dining hall during hall meal served at school separately as well as playing during the recess separately. The extracurricular activities continued to divide. The oral students in extracurricular activities and in the dormitories were provided with separate facilities in order to provide for maximum development of their communicative skills. Likewise, students in the Simultaneous Communication Division were placed in separate facilities in order to develop to the fullest proper manual and oral communication skills except sports (The Utah Eagle, February 1968). Only athletic programs were still offered a social opportunity due to an insufficient number of students from both Oral and Simultaneous Communication Divisions (The Utah Eagle, February 1968; Dale R. Cook, Paul Author, and Linda (Snodgrass) James, personal communication, May 29, 2011).</p>
		<p>At that time, the Oral and Simultaneous Communication Divisions occupied different wings of a U-shaped building. The most challenging in operating a dual track program was scheduling classes and activities in a dormitory and classroom atmosphere conclusive to the development of maximum communication skills (The Utah Eagle, February 1968). Many students from both divisions could no longer tolerate the social segregation atmosphere and the strict oral method among the oral teachers, including Tony Christopulos, a principal who advocated an oral education. For nearly two years from 1966 to 1968, a group of rebelled students attempted to negotiate with Tony to have both departments to merge into one program to no avail (Raymond Monson, personal communication, November 9, 2010).</p>
		<p>(PHOTO)</p>
		<p>In May 1969, Paul Arthur as a Student Council president of the Oral Department and Smiley Briseno as the Student Council president of the Simultaneous Communication Department agreed to plan a walkout strike to end social segregation. Both presidents corroborated with students to draw up a strike plan (Raymond Monson, personal communication, November 9, 2010). Most of them recalled watching the 1962 Student Strike through the classrooms’ window when they were young.</p>
		<p>Three weeks before graduation, which was held at the end of May, both oral and simultaneous students secretly made protest signs in their dorm. In the morning at 8:00 am after the Seminary class of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, more than 100 students, mostly oral from both middle school and high school bravely walked out of the school campus and held protest at the middle of the flag on campus. Tony and Kenneth C. Burdett, a Total Communication Coordinator attempted to stop them, but failed. Eventually, the students walked to the Liberty Park, not far from campus to discuss a new plan. However, Tony met them at the park interrupting their discussion. They suspected the neighbors called alerting Tony their whereabouts (Raymond Monson, personal communication, November 9, 2010; Dale R. Cook, Paul Author, and Linda (Snodgrass) James, personal communication, May 29, 2011).</p>
		<p>Christopolous was not pleased with their walkout strike and threatened the seniors that if they continue, he would take away their high school diploma, which scared them profusely. He would not budge on their demand to end social segregation on school campus. Additionally, Superintendent Robert W. Tegeder ignored their demand and punished the seniors by cancelling the graduation dinner (Dale R. Cook, Paul Author, and Linda (Snodgrass) James, personal communication, May 29, 2011).</p>
		<p>Despite the failure of the walkout, the simultaneous students continued to protest against the segregation policy by frequently walking through the hall of the Oral Department and vice versa for the oral students who had walked through the hall of the Simultaneous Department. Often, some of the students got into fistfights with their oral teachers for oppressing and dominating them as if they were puppets. Superintendent Tegeder was at the point could not handle the situation and contacted the Utah State Board of Education for intervention (Raymond Monson, personal communication, November 9, 2010).</p>
		<p>Because the “Y” system did not appear to work out very well during the few years it operated, Superintendent Tegeder requested help from the Utah State Board of Education, especially Dr. Jay J. Campbell, an Associate Superintendent of Utah State of Education. Dr. Campbell also supervised Utah School for the Deaf and had become interested in the welfare of the deaf children (First Reunion of the Utah School for the Deaf Alumni, 1976; Utah School for the Deaf 100th Year Anniversary Alumni Reunion, 1984; Raymond Monson, personal communication, November 9, 2010).

			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>Raymond Monson (USD ’71), worked at a construction company owned by Don Glen whom had deaf parents, Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Glenn, in the summer of 1969.</p>
			<p>At the construction company, Raymond and Jonathon Hodson, a deaf co-worker were good friend and usually chatted during their lunch break. Looking back in a bitter memory, Raymond expressed his bitter feelings about Dr. Grant B. Bitter and his profound impact on the Utah School for the Deaf and the Seminary Program of the Deaf under the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints. In addition, Raymond was angry at Dr. Bitter for strongly supporting a policy to separate both Oral and Simultaneous Communication Departments at the Utah School for the Deaf as well as having a negative attitude toward the signing students who were placed in the Simultaneous Communication Department. This new reform also impacted the Ogden LDS Branch for the Deaf and its seminary classes, which were held every morning before the students returned to the USD campus for regular classes.</p>
			<p>Raymond recalled that most students from both Oral and Simultaneous Communication Departments did not appreciate the segregation being created between the two departments. Often, the oral teachers looked down at the signing students as if they were nerds. He shared his view that Dr. Bitter was like the obstinate, unmoving wall that divide West Germany and East Germany during the “Cold War” after the World War II ended. Raymond observed that Dr. Bitter never realized or refused to recognize that some deaf students, who could not speak and were forbidden to sign, struggled under the oral system. Raymond compared the strict oralist education to the victims of the communist system that took place in East Germany while other deaf students had freedom to communicate in sign language with their hands compared to those Germans who had freedom of speech in West Germany, a democratic country. Raymond felt that Dr. Bitter did not have right to force deaf children into the oral system and create division among the Deaf community in later years.</p>
			<p>Moreover, Raymond observed that the teachers from the Oral Department did not realize there was discrimination against the signing students by prohibiting them from interacting with oral students in the hallways on school campus. Raymond felt the atmosphere created a negative situation for the students. In addition, he shared his perspectives on "different" kinds of discrimination, like unconsciously treating oral and signing students as whites and blacks of the past.</p>
			<p>Under the “Y “system, Raymond was initially placed in the oral program. He and his mother, Marjorie who was also deaf, were not aware of the new changes until the first day of school in the fall of 1962. He missed his friends who were placed in the Simultaneous Communication Department where he was not allowed to chat with them. He was also not allowed to talk with anyone in sign language. Raymond couldn’t comprehend why he was placed in the oral program until his mother learned that Tony Christopulos, a principal called her husband, Fred who was hearing and see if he would like to enroll Raymond in the oral program. His permission was granted. However, Raymond could not speak very well and became very unhappy in the oral program. He rebelled against the strict oral method. His mother tried to convince him to remain in the oral program to please his father. She could read lip and speak, but Raymond was not as skilled when compared to her.</p>
			<p>Raymond recalled watching the previous student strike in 1962 with other oral students. He was eleven years old at the time. As Raymond grew older, he learned that other deaf individuals felt the same about Dr. Bitter and they shared funny jokes about him. One of the funniest men was Roy Cochran (USD ’61) came up with an idea for not naming Dr. Bitter, PhD, but Mr. Bitter, Pin Head Department. It was his way of trying to use humor to uplift the spirit among the Deaf community during the battling journey with Dr. Bitter. Roy “commanded” Raymond to name Dr. Bitter as “Mr. Grant Bitter, Pin Head Department.” He thought it was so funny.</p>
			<p>Raymond was so angry at Dr. Bitter that he decided to draw a cartoon of him at home during the summer of 1969. While he was thinking about the funny jokes about Dr. Bitter from the Deaf community, he had an idea. After the completion of drawing, he showed it to his mother and his brother, Brian who was hard of hearing. They both thought it was funny. He also showed it to Jonathon Hodson at his work next day. Raymond told his mother and brother that he was going to mail the picture to Dr. Bitter's home. However, his mother was worried that Raymond would get punished or get into trouble because of his being a school age. They made a deal that he would not sign his name on his picture. She helped him correct his grammar. He, then typed a paper and looked up a local phone book for Dr. Bitter’s address and mailed it.</p>
			<p>One week later, Jonathon Hodson notified Raymond that he saw a copy of his drawing on his family’s dinner table at home before he left for work that morning. Jonathon promised Raymond that he would not tell anyone about it. Raymond’s mother again begged him that he will neither tell nor boast to anyone about his drawing.</p>
			<p>In the fall of 1969, the UAD leaders made an announcement that Dr. Bitter was very upset about the picture drew by an anonymous. Apparently, Dr. Bitter blamed some of the deaf leaders for that. Dr. Bitter also called for his Oral Deaf Association for Utah meeting and asked the members about who drew the picture (Raymond Monson, personal communication, November 1, 2010). He would not give up finding out who the anonymous was until Dave Mortensen, one of the UAD leaders told him to let it go (Jonathon Hodson, personal communication, May 29, 2011). All those years, Dr. Bitter, apparently had never found out who drew the picture of him (Raymond Monson, personal communication, November 1, 2010).</p>

		<h3 Dr. Grant B. Bitter’s Misconcepted Views of the Deaf Community</h3>
		<p>In 1970, Dr. Grant B. Bitter’s shared his views about separating the signing Deaf from the oral deaf, recommending genetic counseling of Deaf parents, and counseling to develop proper behavior “attitudes and expectations” (Grant B. Bitter Papers, 1970). The Utah Deaf community, apparently aware of Dr. Bitter's views, anonymously sent him a disparaging note, accusing Dr. Bitter of establishing the Oral Deaf Association of Utah for financial gain.</p>
<p>With the increasing recognition of Total Communication, the Deaf community, led by Dr. Robert G. Sanderson, began making their views known to Dr. Bitter. In a letter to Dr. Bitter in January or February of 1970, Dr. Sanderson expressed “concern with guidance and counseling for the hearing-impaired” and the “history and problems of deafness” (R.G. Sanderson, personal communication, 1970). Dr. Bitter responds and offers to “confer with [Dr. Sanderson] in an effort to provide opportunities for you to give some meaningful presentations to University students” (G.B. Bitter, personal communication, March 3, 1970).</p>
<p>While no direct mention of total communication was included in this communication, it appears Dr. Sanderson was concerned that students in the Teacher Training Program were being taught that the signing Deaf community was a divergent group, with multiple problems and needs for counseling. Perhaps Dr. Sanderson was simply responding to Dr. Bitter's views mentioned previously, that Deaf parents should receive genetic counseling and change their attitude to conform to the hearing majority. Dr. Sanderson may have wanted to correct this misconception by presenting or teaching on this subject (Jeff Pollock, personal communication, May 4, 2005).</p>
		<aside>
			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>In Dr. Grant B. Bitter’s Summary of Tenure Report, he shared his perspective regarding the promotion of the “total communication” philosophy throughout the school system of America between 1968 and 1989, particularly from 1970-1978. He said it was really a tragic era because parents in most states lost the right to have oral instructional (spoken language) programs for their deaf children unless they enrolled them in irregular school classes without a great deal of supportive help. Many children simply lost out and were placed in sign language classes. Most of them who used some spoken language initially, did not now have the environment nor incentive to continue aural/oral communication. Their skills deteriorated. By default these children became candidates for the “silent world.”</p>
			<p>Additionally, Dr. Bitter said that many professionals, and parents and other advocates either became too tired of resisting the promotion of sign language with all of its glittering generalities, and/or became convinced that it would work, literally ceased to cooperate in working for quality educational options. Some professionals (very competent ones) left the field for other professional. Others, without the privilege of academic freedom, but persistent, were “destroyed” professionally. He stated, indeed, a “Hell hath no fury like a vested interest masquerading as a moral principle” (A Summary Report for Tenure, 1985).</p>

		<h3>The Parent Teacher Association Divides</h3>
		<p>At around the same time in spring of 1970, a group of parents, Deaf representatives and Utah School for the Deaf staff members met during the Parent Teacher Association meeting to discuss a school touring outside of the state. It was proposed a school visitation to either Missouri or California. Oral advocates such as Boyd Nielsen, USD Oral Coordinator, Robert Nelson, Assistant Oral Coordinator and other oral parents were also present. Most of the oral proponents voted to tour Central School for the Deaf in St. Louis and Missouri School for the Deaf while total communication proponents, as they were called themselves preferred visiting the California School for the Deaf, Riverside, Santa Ana Program for the Deaf, and Buena Park Program for the Deaf in Orange County, California. When they couldn’t agree on where to visit, their disagreements between the two groups were handed to Dr. Walter D. Talbot, State Superintendent of Public Instruction for a final decision. After overseeing the budget, he selected California over Missouri because it was cheaper and closer to Utah.</p>
		<p>Dave Mortensen, Lloyd Perkins, Jack and Harriett Hendrickson, Don Brubaker, and Kenneth Kinner went to California with two USD staff members, Boyd Nielson, Robert Nelson, and other parents. Linda C. Harrop, a PTA president could not go due to pregnancy.</p>
		<p>While visiting the California School for the Deaf, Riverside, they toured the high school algebra class taught by Larry Newman, president of the National Association of the Deaf at this time, the Oral parents asked Larry if there are any students who were in the oral program. He said, “Don’t ask me. Ask the students.” One of the students responded saying he went to the Mary E. Bennett Oral School in Los Angeles and didn’t get the education he needed. He said he found more happiness and got a better education at the Riverside School for the Deaf. The Total Communication group hoped Boyd, Robert, and other parents would keep an open mind on their value in sign language.</p>
		<p>As the day was over, the Oral group returned home while the Total Communication group remained in California for another day to go on unofficial tour at the Santa Ana Program for the Deaf in Santa Ana Unified School District, which was cancelled earlier. Since 1948, an oral program was used until September 19, 1968 when it changed to the Total Communication Approach during the Total Communication Approach movements (Educating Deaf Children by Total Communication, 1970). Dr. Roy K. Holcomb, a Father of Total Communication escorted the group around the school. They were extremely impressed with the program and wish the Oral group was there.</p>
		<p>After returning home from the trip, they met to discuss at their touring experiences and observations of the classrooms. Boyd stood up and said, “I think deaf children can talk.” The advocates of the oral approach clapped supporting him. For years, the controversy over the two major methods used in educating the deaf sparked during the Parent Teacher Association meetings. A group of parents met with Della Loveridge, a State Representative expressed their concern about their controversy situation with the PTA. She suggested they establish an existing PTA for total communication advocates (Kenneth L. Kinner, personal communication, May 14, 2011).</p>
		<p>On May 28, 1970, a group of parents and teachers who supported sign language were concerned about the education being received by deaf children in Utah school. They met in Ogden discussing their experiences of being left out of decisions regarding their children and pushed out of deaf school PTA. Parents expressed their concern about Utah School for the Deaf, located in Ogden and Salt Lake City being given, which system educators should use than how to educate the deaf students. One deaf parent said, “We are not opposed to the oral method, to teaching them to speak” and that “We are opposed to Salt Lake schools refusing to teach sign language.” Another parent said he encountered opposition when trying to switch his child from oral to manual at the end of his elementary school at the Ogden school (Ogden Standard-Examiner, May 29, 1970). Their next meeting was on June 25, 1970 to form a new PTA organization separate from the two existing PTAs at the Utah School for the Deaf in both Ogden and Salt Lake City (Ogden Standard-Examiner, May 29, 1970).</p>
		<h3>Dave Mortensen Gets Involved in the Fight</h3>
		<p>While all things going on at the Utah School for the Deaf in Ogden, Utah, the first part of May 1970 was the turning point in Dave Mortensen, a Deaf leader and also a Deaf father of Deaf daughter, Kristi Lee’s life. He started to have a great interest in politics and advocacy. It was the year he became active as a Utah Association for the Deaf member and took a huge part in changing the education for the deaf system. That day Dave and Helen Foy, whose daughter had been best friends with Kristi for about 4 years, were picking up Kristi and Claudia outside the classroom at Dilworth Elementary school. Dave caught part of the conversation between Claudia and Kristi. He asked them to repeat the conversation because he did not like the look on their faces. He had to coax the girls to spill out whatever what was bothering them. Finally, Kristi and Claudia began sharing horror stories that had gone on for quite a few years behind closed doors at school that the oral teachers were treating them unfairly. Mrs. Foy asked Dave if he was going to do something about it. He replied, “Oh definitely, I am.” Mrs. Foy took Claudia and Kristi to her home while Dave rushed over to the Utah State Board of Education and grabbed Beth Ann Campbell to interpret Dr. Jay J. Campbell and stormed into State Superintendent Dr. Walter Talbot’s office and said, “Are you aware of what is going on behind the deaf classroom’s door?” (Dave Mortensen, personal communication, March 27, 2009; Kristi L. Mortensen, personal communication, June 17, 2011).</p>
		<p>When Dave first became president of the Utah Association for the Deaf in 1971, he took his leadership to a whole new level. As UAD president, he was raring to go and fight the deaf educational system all the way. He felt the deaf were sorely lacking in many things, hence his activities with the Utah State Legislature began. He became concerned about the problems occurring at the Utah School for the Deaf in Ogden, particularly with segregation of oral and sign language students on school campus and sign language being prohibited in the extension classrooms in Salt Lake City. (Dave Mortensen, Renae M. White, Don M. Mortensen, and Kristi L. Mortensen, personal communication, April 17, 2009).</p>
		<h3>Dave Mortensen and A Group of Parents Make Plea</h3>
		<p>From 1962 to 1970, the primary grades, both oral and simultaneous communication methods were still used at the Utah School for the Deaf in Ogden, the oral method was also still used in all primary grades (up to about 18 years of age) in the Salt Lake City Extension Division held at 1415 California Ave (Deseret News, May 19, 1970).</p>
		<p>On May 18, 1970, Dave Mortensen along with eight parents of deaf children asked that their children be educated by the simultaneous communication method of instruction in the Salt Lake City extension of the Ogden-based Utah School for the Deaf (Deseret News, May 19, 1970). They made the plea in a letter to the Governor’s Advisory Council for the Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind and contended that so-called oral methods used in the extension class was not meeting the scholastic and individual needs of their children (Deseret News, May 19, 1970; Salt Lake Tribune, May 19, 1970).</p>
		<p>The parents also protested alleged separation of the oral and simultaneous student at the Ogden main campus (Deseret News, May 19, 1970). Since the “Y” system went into effect in 1962, Dave refused to enroll Kristi at the Ogden main campus because of segregation. He kept her at home and enrolled her in the oral program at Riley School in Salt Lake City at the age of 4 (Dave Mortensen, Renae M. White, Don M. Mortensen, and Kristi L. Mortensen, personal communication, April 17, 2009). One day, four USD employees, including Mrs. Kate Fenton, an oral teacher and Mr. Nielsen, the audiologist sat in the living room trying to coax Kristi’s parents to enroll her at the Ogden campus. Dave asked them why it was so important that she be sent to USD in Ogden. The group told him that she would be a great asset and an example to the State of Utah. Dave and his wife, Shanna flatly told these four people – no, they will not allow their daughter to experience any kind of segregation. Then, the four people left her parents alone, but it was not until Kristi turned 8 and was fitted with body hearing aid in, which benefited her. The school again begged her parents to send Kristi to USD for only a week trial. Her parents did send her, however but she did not like it on the first day because she was placed in the Oral program first, hoping that she would like it but she did not. After that, Kristi never returned back to USD (Kristi Mortensen personal communication, June 17, 2011).</p>
		<h3>Legislative Subcommittee #4 is Established</h3>
		<p>Shortly after meeting with Dr. Walter Talbot and Dr. Jay J. Campbell, Dave Mortensen invited long time Deaf leaders, Dr. Robert G. Sanderson, Ned. C. Wheeler, and Lloyd H. Perkins to the meeting with Dave’s mother’s best friend, State Representative Della Loveridge, D-Salt Lake City who was in the Legislature, about Kristi’s incidents and general deaf education system in Utah in June 1970. Madeline Burton Perkins served as an interpreter. Della promptly set up a Sub-Committee on Education of the Deaf approved by the Utah State Board of Education. That was the beginning of the battle with oralism. For years, strong deaf education advocates, Dr. Robert G. Sanderson and Ned C. Wheeler, needed a parent of a deaf child to speak up. Dave happened to be there to take action to stir up the battle with oralism (Dave Mortensen, personal communication, March 27, 2009).</p>
		<p>During the summer of 1970, the Deaf community – most graduates of Utah School for the Deaf—reported to the Utah State Legislature that the University of Utah did not include total communication pedagogy in the Teacher Preparation Program. The Legislative Subcommittee #4 was established to investigate the oralism versus total communication issue (Subcommittee #4 Minutes, 1970).</p>
		<p>Dr. Robert G. Sanderson, Deaf Advocate, Dr. Robert Erdman, Chairperson of the Department Special Education at the University of Utah, David Mortensen, President of the Utah Association of the Deaf, and Dr. Jay J. Campbell, Deputy Superintendent of the Utah State Board of Education, were key participants on this committee (Subcommittee #4 Minutes, 1970).</p>
		<p>This Subcommittee, headed by Representative Della Loveridge, received letters from the community in support of both methods. Notably, Dr. Bitter solicited letters from Legislative leaders in support of the oral program. The Deaf community received support from Britt M. Hargraves, Director of the Teacher Training Program at Western Maryland College, in support of a Total Communication program (B.M. Hargraves, personal communication, August 17, 1970). Dr. Hargraves evidence of the failure of the oral program at Utah School for the Deaf was that there were only two graduates of USD at Gallaudet College [now University] in Washington, D.C. In an interesting but obscure turn of events, the Deaf community received a letter of support for establishing a Total Communication program at the University from the Utah State AFL-CIO only to have that support retracted three months later (AFL-CIO, personal communication, September 2, 1970). The AFL-CIO took a neutral stance until all members could fully understand the issue (AFL-CIO, personal communication, December 9, 1970). The reason for this retraction deserves further exploration, however, it reflects on the intensity of the controversy at the time.</p>
		<p>One issue that the Subcommittee discussed was establishing a Total Communication program at Utah State University (Subcommittee #4 Minutes, October 28, 1970). However, it was moved, and seconded by Dr. Erdman, that such a program not be established (Jeff Pollock, personal communication, May 4, 2005).</p>
		<h3>Oral Approach To Teaching Deaf Defends at Confab</h3>
		<p>Soon after Dave Mortensen spoke against the physical abuse in the classrooms and segregation with the Ogden main campus, on June 15, 1970, appropriately 250 people, mostly advocates of the oral approach jammed into a room of the University of Utah’s Milton Bennion Hall for the four-hour general meeting of the Oral Deaf Association of Utah founded by Dr. Grant B. Bitter.</p>
		<p>The Utah School for the Deaf, located in Ogden and its Salt Lake Extension division was under attack by critics for allegedly favoring the oral approach over the total communication methodology. The petitions also alleging physical abuse by oral teachers upon manual students; discriminatory practices, failure by the oral teachers to teach students as well as failure to teach students to go to [deaf] church, oral students not vocationally prepared; oral students not taught the difference between right and wrong, and assertations against the teacher education in deaf education a the University of Utah. The petitions were submitted to state governmental and educational officials (Salt Lake Tribune, June 16, 1970; Deseret News, June 16, 1970).</p>
		<p>Dr. Bitter denied all of these accusations. He labeled the assertions made against the oral system were “unfounded and unwarranted.” In his printed handout stated:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>“In my judgment, a lock of protocol as has been used in regard to the accusations made against...the educational system, parents, of oral students, a religious educational program and the teacher education program a the University of Utah is completely unjustified” (Salt Lake Tribune, June 16, 1970; Deseret News, June 16, 1970).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Tempers flared during the meeting when several total communication proponents suggested the merge of oral method into the simulation communication method should be taught together. Dr. Bitter stated, “Any meeting of the oral method with the manual alphabet and the system of signs as proposed by some would be totally incompatible with oral education – in fact, it would cease to be oral education” (Deseret News, June 16, 1970).</p>
		<h3>Public Controversy Continue to Spark During the Summer of 1970</h3>
		<p>In June 1970, the public controversy continued to spark at the meetings and through petition signing as well as the letters to the press. Around 400 parents and friends signed a petition in support of and endorsed the present system, which says in part:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>“The best hope for a hearing-impaired child to learn to communicate adequately, and use compete successfully in the modern world, is through early and continued oral education. Since the inception of the Extension Division of the School for the Deaf, instruction has been purely oral. As a result of employing the oral method students in the Extension Division have learned to communicate in a normal environment, with the result that integration in classes of normal students start at or complete at the high school level.</p>
			<p>Now therefore, be it resolved by parents and friends of the Extension Division, School for the Deaf, that the oral method offers the best hope for hearing-impaired children to adjust to a normal environment, and to compete successfully in society.</p>
			<p>Be it further resolved that the Extension Division of the School for the Deaf is commended for its progressive and successful program, and is urged to continue teaching by the oral method” (Heinrich, Deseret News, June 16, 1970; Wight, Ogden Standard-Examiner, October 20, 1970).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Margaret Heinrich, a parent of a deaf child stated in her <em>Deseret News</em> article that a majority of parents realized there was a small minority of parents in Salt Lake City who were not in agreement with them, and they hoped that the Governor’s Advisory Council and the State Advisory Committee for the Handicapped will recognize the predominantly large majority of parents who desired the present approach in the education of their children (Heinrich, Deseret News, June 16, 1970).</p>
		<p>Somewhere there was a debate that the students who were in the oral program on the Ogden main campus should be permitted to socialize with those who had simultaneous method instruction (Cummins, Salt Lake Tribune, December 12, 1970). Dr. Grant B. Bitter was still unwilling to accept the merger between the oral and simulation communication methods because it was incompatible.</p>
		<h3>Parents of Deaf Form Separate PTA Organization</h3>
		<p>Because of the educational philosophy difference, a group of over 100 parents and members of the Deaf community voted at the meeting in Ogden on June 25, 1970 to form a new PTA organization separate from the two existing at the Utah School for the Deaf in both Ogden and Salt Lake City (Ogden Standard-Examiner, June 26, 1970).</p>
		<p>The name of a new organization was the Parent-Teacher-Student Association and it was established in Salt Lake City, Utah. First president of the PTSA was Jack W. Hendrickson (hearing). His wife, Harriet was elected secretary. The other officers included were vice presidents, Dave Mortensen and Normay Foy, treasure Kenneth L. Kinner and historian Karen Williams (Ogden Standard-Examiner, June 26, 1970; (Kenneth L. Kinner, personal communication, May 14, 2011).</p>
		<p>PTSA was comprised of parents of deaf children, students, teachers of the Utah School for the Deaf, and both deaf and hearing people interested in the objectives of PTSA. PTSA focused on deaf students’ aspects of linguistic, educational and social needs. The general PTA changed its name to Extension Oral PTA in Salt Lake City, Utah (Kenneth L. Kinner, personal communication, May 14, 2011).</p>
		<h3>Deaf Teaching Methods Debate at the State Capitol Auditorium</h3>
		<p>On July 27, 1970, presentations were made on the “oral” and the “total communication” of educating deaf children at the State Capitol auditorium sponsored by the Governor’s Advisory Council’s another Deaf, Blind, and Socio Economic Handicapped Children Subcommittee. The speakers were Dr. McCay Vernon (hearing) noted expert on Deaf Education and Dr. June Miller, a professor at Kansas State Medical School and an expert on oral education.</p>
		<p>Approximately 200 persons consisted of representatives of the State Board of Higher Education, State Board of Education, state superintendent of public instruction, Governor’s Advisory Council, superintendent, principals, PTA presidents, State Senate President, and Speaker of the House (The Salt Lake Tribune, 1970; The Deseret News, July 27, 1970). Many deaf people, Dr. Robert G. Sanderson, Ned C. Wheeler, Dave Mortensen, Lloyd Perkins, Joseph Burdett, Roy C. Cochran and Kenneth Kinner were also present. Methods of educating deaf children were discussed at the auditorium (The Salt Lake Tribune, 1970).</p>
		<p>To a packed auditorium, Dr. Vernon asserted that “the overwhelming number of deaf people fail educationally or are forced to fail because of the way they are taught.” Dr. Miller defended the advantage of the oral method while he was a firm backer of the total communication. They engaged a heated debate sharpening their messages on oral vs. total communication. During the debate, Dr. Vernon said, “The deaf are “just as bright...they have just as high IQs as hearing people.” He also stated, “But the relative proportion of deaf children going to college has decreased.” Dr. Miller told the audience that proponents of the two methods agreed on many things, such as early identification of the problem, education of the problem, education of the parents and the need for job placement. However, their disagreement was in the area of communication, she said. She also said, “We must concentrate on ways to improve oral instruction.” Dr. Miller criticized several aspects of the oral method, such as failure to consider individual differences in pupils, lack of teacher motivation, oversized classes and lack of a consistent program (Deseret News, 1970, p. 2B).</p>
		<p>Dr. Miller also said Utah’s program of teaching the deaf was “distinct.” “It made it possible for each child to enter the adult world” (Deseret News, 1970, p. 2B). Dr. Vernon cited findings from several studies indicating superiority of the total communication over the strictly oral method. He warned that the educational method must change before the deaf person is completely out of the picture (Deseret News, 1970, p. 2B). During the 1960s and 1970s, the research consistently showed that Deaf children of Deaf parents had greater academic achievement, reading and writing, and social development than Deaf children of hearing parents (Israelite, Ewoldt, &#38; Hoffmeister, 1989).</p>
		<p>On that day, Dr. Grant B. Bitter sent the Legislative Subcommittee #4 a letter in opposition to Dr. Vernon's presentation, stating that there was no research that total communication was a viable method, and clarifying that it is not a method, but a vague philosophy which only serves to confuse students (G.B. Bitter, personal communication, August 5, 1970; Jeff Pollock, personal communication, May 4, 2005).</p>
		<p>Representative Della Loveridge, chair of the Advisory Council’s subcommittee was aware of the Utah School for the Deaf’s early method in instructing deaf children in the oral program through the sixth grade, and then selected children on an individuals basis for additional training in the total communication method. She said the subcommittee will make a recommendation to the entire committee and to the Governor Calvin L. Rampton as to whether the total communication method should be taught to Utah deaf children at an earlier age and whether Utah colleges need to upgrade education of teachers of the deaf (Salt Lake Tribune, July 17, 1970).</p>

			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>Research indicates that all school children, especially English as second language learners, must master two types of communication skills in order to achieve their educational goals: Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills (BICS) and Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP).</p>
			<p>BICS includes the social and conversational communication skills that are attained through daily interaction with family and peer interaction.</p>
			<p>CALP requires BICS and is acquired through explicit learning. The setting, context, and conversational partners, which are found in the K-12 environment, also assist with the development of CALP.</p>
			<p>The majority of Deaf and hard-of-hearing students lack exposure to sign language in their early, developmental years and are often likely to be lacking in BICS. Therefore, when they enter elementary school, their lack of BICS impedes with their ability to fully participate in the classroom and with their peers. Hence, their ability to acquire CALP is delayed. This is shown with the lowered reading abilities and general performance scores that are reported across the board (Cummins &#38; Swain, 1986). In other words, many Deaf children never fully acquire CALP, which is fundamental for academic success.</p>

		<h3>The Parent-Teacher-Student Association Speaks Up</h3>
		<p>In 1970, the Parent-Teacher-Student Association made an impact when they spoke up for a new reformation within the Dual Track Program by offering the choices between oral and simultaneous communication. For nearly ten years, Deaf community and parents who supported sign language fought against the “Y” system and no one had listened. Finally, the new PTSA was able to voice their concerns and to influence policies at the school (Kenneth L. Kinner, personal communication, May 14, 2011). Obviously, many parents were unable to be fully cooperative as well as to believe wholeheartedly in a Dual Track Program, as emphasized in The Utah Eagle article entitled, “New Developments in Utah’s Educational Programs for the Deaf” dated February 1968.</p>
		<h3>Utah State Board of Education To Consider Ways of Teaching Deaf</h3>
		<p>For months, the controversy was over whether the deaf children at the Utah School for the Deaf should be instructed by the oral or the simultaneous method. Another controversy rose over whether the two programs should be allowed to mingle (Chaffin, Deseret News, December 12, 1970).</p>
		<p>There were also bombarded by differing parental opinions. In the oral method, most parents who had normal hearing preferred their children to be taught to lip-read and to speak on the assumption they will be able to function in the larger society. In the simultaneous communication method, on the other hand, was supported by most parents who themselves were deaf, the students were taught oral skills if they can master them, but also were taught to finger spell, and to use sign language (Chaffin, Deseret News, December 12, 1970).</p>
		<p>The State Advisory Committee for Handicapped chaired by Senator Ernest H. Dean, D-American Fork and the Committee for Study of Programs of the Deaf, chaired by Dr. Moroni H. Brown, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Utah had a challenge to decide what direction changes should be attempted. During the fall of 1970, these committees conducted extensive study of the educational program of the Utah School for the Deaf to prepare their report to the Utah State Board of Education (Ogden Standard-Examiner, October 20, 1970).</p>
		<p>After many meetings, both committees compiled a list of seventeen recommendations. On December 11, 1970, they made oral presentation of their findings and recommendations to the Utah State Board of Education. Additionally, written recommendations were submitted to the Board on behalf of the committees. The recommendations were a combination of existing policy at the USD. The Board adopted the recommendations (Subcommittee #4 Recommendations, 1970).</p>
		<p>During the special meeting on that day, the State Board listened to the reports of two committees’ studies of the deaf school issues, and of the proponents of two programs of instruction for deaf children (Chaffin, Deseret News, December 12, 1970). Dr. Brown, also a former state board member reported for his group’s subcommittee on Deaf, Blind and Socio-Economic Handicapped, which was headed by former Representative Della L. Loveridge (Chaffin, Deseret News, December 12, 1970). Based on Representative Loveridge’s subcommittee’s report after interviewing a number of students at the Ogden campus, it was recommended socialization between all deaf children be enhanced (Cummins, Salt Lake Tribune, December 12, 1970).</p>
		<p>Dean’s committee recommended greater socialization while Dr. Brown’s committee urged segregation of the two methods until high school (Chaffin, Deseret News, December 12, 1970). Dr. Brown’s group recommended those students housed in the school’s dormitories be separated during the junior high school years but allowed to socialize when they reach high school age (Cummins, Salt Lake Tribune, December 12, 1970).</p>
		<p>Dr. Brown’s committee also recommended those students who could succeed orally should continue their education in the public school system while those who should remain on the Ogden campus. Some parents of the oral group felt their children should be separated to ensure they are not exposed to sign language while parents of other children felt the separation was discriminatory. He stated his group felt the USD should decide what is right for individual child and he did not think there can be a rigid line (Cummins, Salt Lake Tribune, December 12, 1970; Chaffin, Deseret News, December 12, 1970).</p>
		<p>At that time, all students received oral instruction through the sixth grade in the “Y” system and their instruction was separated after it was determined whether or not they remain in the oral program or transfer to the simultaneous communication program. Dr. Brown’s committee recommended that there be two programs, which would begin as soon as the child was identified as deaf. They felt the two programs should be continuous through all grade levels and the child could be transferred from one program to another if needed (Cummins, Salt Lake Tribune, December 12, 1970).</p>
		<p>Keith Winegar, Bountiful spoke for the Oral Deaf Association of Utah told the board members, “We have taken a firm stand that the oral program is a necessary and proper approach to the education of our children. We don’t want to take anything away from the simultaneous-trained students, but we do not want the programs intermingled. It has to be one thing or another. Parents should be able to choose.” He criticized the “outside pressure” which were deteriorating the oral program at the Ogden School and warned that his group would take “extreme measures” if they continue to chip away at our program” (Cummins, Salt Lake Tribune, December 12, 1970). Dr. Thomas C. Clark, assistant professor of the Communication Disorders Department at Utah State University, spoke for deaf parents. He declared that settling on one method “denies individually.”Some children must have opportunity to learn by the simultaneous communication method and that it must be available at a very early age” (Chaffin, Deseret News, December 12, 1970). Dr. Clark suggested that the decision be made by parents or diagnostician and parents together as early as the child’s life as thirty months. (Cummins, Salt Lake Tribune, December 12, 1970).</p>
		<p>Urging the state of Utah to declare its policy on teaching deaf children, Vera M. Gee, chairman of the Governor’s Advisory Council for the Utah School for the Deaf and Blind pointed out, “We went through this 10 years ago and we are saying the same things again” (Cummins, Salt Lake Tribune, December 12, 1970). The committees agreed on three points:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>That deaf children be identified as early as possible</li>
			<li>That their parents be counseled to understand both their responsibility and the programs, which are available to help children</li>
			<li>That the Utah School for the Deaf offer both oral and simultaneous program at all grade levels and that parents be able to choose the method of instruction to be used with their children (Chaffin, Deseret News, December 12, 1970).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>After Vera made the comment, Sheldon Allred, a board member urged the Board to meet in special meeting and declare its policy (Cummins, Salt Lake Tribune, December 12, 1970). The action took place at another special meeting and brought about compromise solution to a heated debate that had existed between parents of deaf children and teachers for nearly 10 years (Cummins, Salt Lake Tribune, December 29, 1970).</p>

		<h3>Dr. Grant B. Bitter’s View on 17 Recommendations</h3>
		<p>Some of these 17 recommendations supported the continuance of the oral and total communication tracks, with more formal procedures. Other recommendations included an orientation for parents that included the different communication methodologies; the vocational placement program be expanded and function in harmony with both oral and total communication programs; establishment of procedures to hear from concerned citizens and take action on those concerns; and certification requirements for teacher preparation programs for the deaf include some form of manual training. The Board adopted the final recommendations for the operation of the USD (Subcommittee #4 Recommendations, 1970)</p>
		<p>However, the final recommendations were objected to by Dr. Bitter on several grounds. These included, 1) the study was not undertaken properly with respect to guidelines, procedures, and conditions, 2) there was no representation by some groups, 3) some persons spoke as authorities but were not, 4) there was a delay in the selection of members to the committee, 5) the committee became a grand jury, and 6) information was released that should not have been (G.B. Bitter, personal communication, December 18, 1970; Jeff Pollock, personal communication, May 4, 2005).</p>
		<h3>A New Dual Track Program with Choices</h3>
		<p>While Superintendent Robert W. Tegeder received assistance from the Utah State Board of Education and Dr. Jay J. Campbell, the Parent-Teacher-Students proposed to the Governor’s Advisory Council (later renamed to Institutional Council) a Dual Track Program be replaced the “Y” System and that a new program be designed to provide options for parents to choose between oralism and simultaneous communication. At this time, Ned C. Wheeler was chairperson of the Governor’s Advisory Council, formerly known as Advisory Council. Upon approval, the proposal was then submitted to the Utah State Board of Education for final approval (First Reunion of the Utah School for the Deaf Alumni, 1976; Utah School for the Deaf 100th Year Anniversary Alumni Reunion, 1984; Kenneth L. Kinner, personal communication, 2006). [PHOTO]</p>
		<h3>Utah State Board of Education Adopts A New Policy for the Utah School for the Deaf</h3>
		<p>The communication methodology battle reached its peak when the Utah State Board of Education halted a nearly 10-year-old dispute and adopted a new policy to help Utah School for the Deaf resolve its educational philosophy differences on December 28, 1970 (Deseret News, December 29, 1970).</p>
		<p>Based on 17 recommendations proposed to Dr. Walter D. Talbot, state superintendent of public instruction, and his staff, the new policy basically offered the Utah School for the Deaf a “Two-Track” instructional system. This new system allowed the students to transfer from one program to the other and provided professional evaluation on new transfer the students would benefit (Cummins, Salt Lake Tribune, December 29, 1970). Apparently, the State Board ignored Dr. Grant B. Bitter’s concerns regarding the 17 recommendations.</p>
		<p>The second major element in the policy changed was that the students at Utah School for the Deaf will be in separate programs academically in both junior high and high school so that the signing students would not infect the oral students with their signing, (Ogden Standard-Examiner, December 29, 1970; (USBE, 1973; Jeff Pollock, personal communication, May 4, 2005).</p>
		<p>There was some integration socially and at athletic events (Salt Lake Tribune, December 29, 1970). Dr. Robert W. Tegeder, superintendent of the Utah School for the Deaf said the total separation of two programs was based on the reports of two committees (Cummins, Salt Lake Tribune, December 29, 1970).</p>
		<p>Out of 17 recommendations, School Policy Number One stated that both the oral/aural and total communication (previously simultaneous communication) programs should be made available to each student. School Policy Number Two defined the placement of children within the programs. It stated that the student and parent should be important factors in determining placement (Campbell, 1977, p. 49).</p>
		<p>Superintendent Tegeder called the board decision “nothing really earthshaking” and a compromise set of guidelines not really much different from what has been in operation at the school. He also did not see a clear-cut victory for either side in the dispute. He pointed out that arguments on the best way to educate the deaf have been going on in this country for 100 years or more and in the state of Utah for around 84 years and will probably continue. The State Board merely took the reports from the committees and accommodated them. They rejected to allow the state to operate only one program at the USD, or a second that two programs be conducted, but that they be kept entirely separate physically (Ogden Standard-Examiner, December 29, 1970).</p>
		<p>When the State Board’s final approval reached Dr. Jay J. Campbell’s hands, he changed the structure in the “Two Track” Program, allowing parents to have a choice (First Reunion of the Utah School for the Deaf Alumni, 1976; Utah School for the Deaf 100th Year Anniversary Alumni Reunion, 1984; Kenneth L. Kinner, personal communication, 2006).</p>
		<p>Attached are Recommendations on Policy for the Utah School for the Deaf.</p>
		<p>Policy One and Policy Two were part of the recommendations as listed below. (APPENDIX)</p>
		<h3>“Two-Track” Education System</h3>
		<p>The “Two-Track” Education System at the Utah School for the Deaf became official in the 1971-1972 school year (Ogden Standard-Examiner, December 29, 1970). USD offered a dual track: an oral/aural program in one department and a total communication program in another department, at both the residential school and the extension program in the Salt Lake area (First Reunion of the Utah School for the Deaf Alumni, 1976; Utah School for the Deaf 100th Year Anniversary Alumni Reunion, 1984). This provided parents a choice between the total communication method of instruction or the oral method of instruction for a deaf child from thirty months to twenty-one years old of age (Kenneth L. Kinner, personal communication, May 14, 2011).</p>
		<p>Majority of the oral parents still preferred the separation of their children from the signing children to be ensured so that they will not be exposed to sign language. Both oral and total communication continued to be separated on Ogden campus. The oral students who attended the campus were eventually transferred to mainstreamed settings in elementary school, middle school and high school nearby.</p>
		<p>Since Dave Mortensen spoke up during the early summer of 1970, he carried his torch fighting for the right of deaf children to props education. It was his deaf daughter who inspired him to become a true advocate of deaf children’s right to fair access to education, the same as hearing students, and not be left out (Dave Mortensen, Renae M. White, Don M. Mortensen, and Kristi L. Mortensen, personal communication, April 17, 2009).</p>
		<h3>Utah School for the Deaf Leads Parents Into the Oral Program</h3>
		<p>While a “Two-Track” Education Program existed for students and parents to have a choice between oralism and total communication, parents were still encouraged to place their children in the oral program and only consider the total communication program if progress was not being made (Kenneth L. Kinner, personal communication, 2006; Mortensen, UAD Bulletin, June 1975; Campbell, 1977; Jeff Pollock, personal communication, May 4, 2005).</p>
		<p>It was a goal for the “Two-Track&quot; Education program to provide advantages that a single program cannot offer. However, Dr. Jay J. Campbell noticed that Utah School for the Deaf did not comply with these two new policies. The two programs were not made equally available to each student and the placement of students was not based on professional evaluation of student need. He was concerned that the Parent Infant Program at USD led parents to commit to the oral program while also restricting the availability of the total communication program for their child. It was the PIP program, not the parents, who would start the deaf children in the oral program, only recommending the total communication program if progress in speech skills was not being made. Historical records show that the PIP program and the USD’s general student placement procedures tended to place the more promising students in the oral program while students with multiple disabilities were placed in the total communication program. This tendency still continues today and makes the signing program look like a failure (Campbell, 1977).</p>
		<p>Dr. Campbell stated that children who went into the total communication program were often considered failures, not having been successful with the oral program. For instance, when the normal deaf children couldn’t make it “orally,” they were transferred from the oral program to the total communication program. Lane (1999) said the same thing that when this occurred, students were labeled <em>oral failures</em>, a label which undoubtedly had a deleterious effect on the students. Their best learning opportunity while in the oral program had been lost. These oral students had been taught that the total communication was not a good philosophy. Now that they failed in the oral program and were transferred to the total communication program, they disliked it, which caused self-image problems (Campbell, 1977; Jeff Pollock, personal communication, May 4, 2005).</p>
		<p>With the problem of inappropriate placement, Dr. Campbell discovered that the most of the USD staff assumed that signing inhibited oral language development, so they recommended initial placement in the oral program unless the child had additional disabilities or the parents preferred the total communication program (Campbell, 1977). Furthermore, the coordinators and staff members of both the oral and total communication programs believed their own program to be better for most students than the alternative program. Campbell (1977) stated that “they offered only one communicative system for all deaf children were denying children the most important educational alternative that a deaf child needs” (p. 82). If the child was not making adequate academic progress in the oral program, the staff conference was called to discuss alternative placement. The conference consisted of one or both curriculum coordinators, the principal, audiologist, and a teacher. Students were never invited to the meeting and parents were seldom invited (Campbell, 1977).</p>
		<p>Dr. Campbell expressed his concern regarding the placement of students in one or the other was, according to Policy Two, the responsibility of the professional staff members. The effect of this policy was to create interminable conflicts and unprofessional placement decisions. His concern expressed no uniform periodic assessment of placement nor was there adequate objective test data to evaluate placements. It was recommended that decisions concerning placement, of students in programs, not be made the responsibility of the staff or administration of the school. In addition, it was recommended that the administration of the two programs be completely separated, not combined under a common principal (Campbell, 1977). Ironically, a member of the Utah State Board of Education, Janet Cannon’s question fit Dr. Campbell’s suggestion. In 2004, she asked the Institutional Council to see if USD should be headed by one administrator officer, or should each school have its own principal?</p>
		<p>It was not Dr. Campbell’s desire to abolish either program although he understood that two distinct philosophies of education of the deaf were coexisting on the campus and that there will be problems as long as this was the situation (Jan Langley, personal communication, October 20, 1971). Hence, he recommended that the “two track system” be continued in completely separate programs in order to solve the internal/external strife between the Oral and Total Communication Programs and reduce competition, as well as tension among these programs. Each program should have its own dean, its own supervisor, its own principal, its own teachers and students emphasis. Additionally, through feedback among the USD teachers, the principals favored one program to another. They were spread too thin to do a good job, and were unable to develop any personal rapport and relationships with faculty members due to commitment with the various extension programs and the two on-campus divisions (Campbell, 1977). Because of all the problems and tension faced by the USD staff, the teachers supported the recommendation of hiring two principals: one for the Oral Department and the other for the Total Communication Department. It was almost impossible for one principal to supervise adequately two different philosophies in the extension division and the residential school. Another recommendation was for two separate facilities to house the two departments. Due to the State Board policy, separate programs were not allowed, but USD could have the students located in two separate facilities so that the oral program could be in a total oral environment and the total communication program could be developed separately, because they felt the present principal was not fully committed to their educational philosophy (Campbell, 1977).</p>
		<h3>A Revolutionary Notion of Total Communication</h3>
		<p>While Dave Mortensen and a group of parents asked that their deaf children be educated by the total communication method of instruction on May 18, 1970, Robert W. Tegeder, superintendent of the Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind shared with the Governor’s Advisory Council that about 90 percent of the nation’s schools for the deaf used the oral method for instruction of children up to 10 or 12 years of age (Deseret News, May 19, 1970). For years, the state schools for the deaf used the oral method for preschool and elementary school children than the day schools, like the Santa Ana Deaf Program, for example (Educating Deaf Children, 1970).</p>
		<p>Out of frustration with the narrowness and rigidity of oralism in the education of the deaf in the nation, Dr. Roy Holcomb, a deaf teacher and member of the Leadership Training Program in the Area of the Deaf at San Fernando Valley State College at Northridge, California (This is where Dr. Robert G. Sanderson received his Master’s Degree there), was a strong advocate of all means of communication for the deaf. Dr. Holcomb’s plans for the Total Communication Approach were written in 1967 while he was a member of the staff at the Indiana School for the Deaf. The plans were first discussed with Dr. Ray Hones and Dr. Lloyd Johns, faculty members of the Leadership Training Program in the Area of the Deaf in 1968, before being out into operation at the start of the 1968-69 school year in Santa Ana (Educating Deaf Children, 1970). He felt that good communication was the key to a deaf child’s successful learning process.</p>
		<p>This revolutionary notion, was introduced, Total Communication in 1967 to promote the right of a deaf child to access all modes of communication available to develop language competency (Educating Deaf Children, 1970; Hawkin &#38; Brawner, 1997). During the 1970s and 1980s, the adoption of “Total Communication” at many schools restored the use of ASL in classrooms for the first time since the early 1900’s (Hawkin &#38; Brawner, 1997). This philosophy became the fastest-growing movement in the history of deaf education. The methodological controversy raged on. Utah was no exception.</p>
		<p>The original idea was to incorporate all possible means communication with deaf students through a variety of methods to communicate in the classroom. However, the rapid spread of Total Communication in the 1970s and 1980s took place during a time when there was a sudden and seemingly uncontrollable increase in the development of artificial codes for representing English. Many teachers could not sign well and made little or no effort to learn. Those who knew sign language utilized spoken and written English and in actual practice, it devolved into speaking English and simultaneously signing the prominent words in what was spoken in English word order (Lane, Hoffmeister, &#38; Bahan, 1996).</p>
		<p>The name of the communication method known as Simultaneous Communication was replaced with Total Communication because it was an innovative idea at the time. The adoption of Total Communication at many schools restored the use of American Sign Language in the classroom for the first time since the early 1800s and 1900s (Gannon, 1981).</p>
		<p>In practice, American Sign Language, the language of the Deaf community, was however rarely used in the classroom, unless the teacher happened to be deaf. While many state schools for the deaf adopted the use of sign language, Utah School for the Deaf did not exactly join the many state schools for the deaf, which favored using sign language and dropped using the oral approach.</p>
		<aside>
			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>Total Communication is a philosophy, an important development in the history of educating American deaf students in classrooms during that time. Dr. Roy Holcomb became known as the “Father of Total Communication” (Hawkin &#38; Brawner, 1997).</p>
		</aside>
		<h3>An Inequality Education in the Total Communication Program</h3>
		<p>On May 18, 1970, Dave Mortensen and other parents of deaf children asked that the Total Communication Program be implemented in the Salt Lake City extension. He felt his daughter, Kristi along with other deaf children had the right to use sign language. Additionally, he argued that if the oral had classes in Salt Lake City, why not be fair and let the students have sign language classes in that area as well. He won the argument and sign language classes were provided when his deaf daughter, Kristi entered Glendale Junior High school (Dave Mortensen, Renae M. White, Don M. Mortensen, and Kristi L. Mortensen, personal communication, April 17, 2009).</p>
		<p>During the first year of the Total Communication program in 1971, Superintendent Robert W. Tegeder and Principal Tony Christopulos had placed four deaf students, including Kristi at Glendale Junior High school in the Salt Lake area. However, the problems arose for them and it was not a smooth sailing for them, as the Utah School for the Deaf claimed they will ensure that the sign language classes in that school will happen.</p>
		<p>The first year in 1971, Kristi entered Glendale Junior High school. However, the USD failed to arrange the interpreting service for her mainstream classrooms. She had to lip-read and depend on student’s notes. The USD did promise that the interpreters would be provided, but it did not happen.</p>
		<p>While in 1960, the war over the oral philosophy had begun, the oral students were attending Glendale Junior High school. When the “Y” system was initiated, the USD moved the oral program to a better area and the schools were East High School and Clayton Junior High. Those schools were located in the upper middle to upper class area and were known in the 70’s and 80’s the best top schools in the state of Utah.</p>
		<p>The USD indicated their favors of the Oral Program over the Total Communication Program by putting Kristi and the three other students in Glendale Junior High school in the poorest section of South Salt Lake neighborhood in Salt Lake County, including Rose Park area. Kristi, along with three other students were unhappy and dissatisfied with any of the programs and classes available at Glendale Junior High school.</p>
		<p>For years, the USD was used to having oral students, who did not know sign language, participating in the Glendale Junior High school activities without any complaints. The USD principal and teachers did not support sign language due to its distraction to hearing students. Dave had to fight a little bit harder forcing USD to pay for interpreters for assemblies, special presentations, or field trips and school plays and also to convince both USD and Glendale Junior High school that having interpreters for specific events would benefit the deaf students.</p>
		<p>USD finally gave in and paid for the interpreting service, however Dave demanded that the interpreters not being provided by that school. Glendale Junior High school counselor finally realized the importance of having sign language interpreters. The counselor then convinced Glendale Junior High school to let the Deaf students to take part in the monthly talent show, Christmas program, and Spring/The End of the School Year plays/chorus with the presence of an interpreter.</p>
		<p>The students still didn’t like the area where their school, Glendale Junior High was located at. During the 2nd years of the Total Communication program in 1972, USD took no regards in making sure that the Total Communication students were being housed in the right mainstream school in a better location. The parents did not receive the letter until about two weeks prior to the first day of school – as always a day after the Labor’s Day.</p>
		<p>Despite the Total Communication students’ objection, the USD could care less and moved them to the Northwest Junior High school in Rosepark. In 1970’s, this school was in a bad place; the education and morale were very low. Although the parents and Deaf community had won the battle by establishing the Two-Track Program giving parents choices, the Total Communication students however took the worst bite while the students in the Oral Program did not have to worry about receiving services as well as resources they needed, such as oral interpreters, note takers, and full attention from teachers to meet their quote unquote succeed. Kristi remembered a social gathering event with her oral friends where they told her that when they make a request from Superintendent Tededger and Principal Christopulos, they would make sure to get it in a heartbeat. As the conversations went on about what they were receiving while attending the mainstream classes, Kristi was dumfounded to discover that they were being given quote unquote silver platter while the Total Communication program had to work hard to earn that silver platter by fighting and demanding their equal right to services and resources. Kristi reported to her father, Dave about the Oral Program having so many things while in the Total Communication program lacked. She suspected that Dr. Grant B. Bitter and Tony Christopulos were trying to prove that Oral Program had better services for the deaf students and to attract the new enrollments into the program. USD had just simply refused to comply with the agreements needed for the Total Communication students, especially in Junior High. It was a major struggle in the first year.</p>
		<p>When Dave discovered that USD had placed the Total Communication students at Northwest Junior High school, the worst section in northwest area of Salt Lake City, he pulled Kristi out immediately and enrolled her to a neighborhood school, Riverview Junior High. Dave met with the principal of that school and requested that a sign language interpreter be provided. He agreed. United Way was able to chip in the cost while the Murray School District helped pay. Dave found an interpreter and hired her to work with Kristi. Dave had worked very closely with Riverview Junior High Principal and Murray School District. Compared to USD, they were easy to work with and agreed with Dave’s demands that Kristi gets full access while attending Riverview Junior High. While there – Dave, Shanna, and Kristi were able to experience some peace for the time being.</p>
		<p>While the other three deaf students of Total Communication program were attending Northwest Junior High, some parents were surprised to find that Kristi was not attending that school. The parents met with Dave and questioned what went on. Dave had reminded the parents that USD were not helping paying for the mileage driven by the parents. At this time, it was about 30 to 35 miles round trip with understanding that the freeway was not at its best as it is today. The parents were upset and wrote a letter to USD Superintendent Tegeder and Principal of Salt Lake City deaf schools, including Tony Christopulos, demanding that they pull their son and daughters out of Northwest Junior High and to transfer them to Riverview Junior High. That school was much closer to where they lived – Riverton, West Jordan, and Kearns. After a month or two – Superintendent Tedeger and Principal Christopulos finally transferred the deaf students to Riverview Junior High school, but they still would not budge with their parents’ request in providing the interpreting service for these three students simply because they were under the USD system while Kristi was under the Murray School District. Dave became exasperated with the games USD was playing with deaf students and parents’ feelings in the Total Communication program. As per Dave, both Riverview Junior High school and Murray School District wrote a letter to Supt and Principal demanding that they must help to offset costs for interpreters for extra-curricular activities and some mainstream classes for these three deaf students, which was granted. The bottom line – regardless the battle won the war remained.</p>
		<p>The Total Communication Program had established in the Salt Lake area, however the USD put the Total Communication Program as 2nd class while the Oral program had the best of everything, particularly in the top, nice areas.</p>
		<p>Only two of Kristi’s oral classmates out of 20 from Dilworth Elementary School (They eventually moved there from Riley Elementary school) went to college and graduated. These two students had become close friends to Dave and Shanna and went to their place for gathering. Dave had served as a role model and motivated them to go to college even though they struggled academically. In spring 1976, Kristi left for Gallaudet College, not completing the last half of 11th and 12th grade due to her frustrations with the influence of the USD system (Kristi L. Mortensen, personal communication, June 17, 2011).</p>
		<p>By the time the total communication was introduced in 1967; it had replaced the oralism as the primary method of teaching in most day and residential settings (Baldwin, 1990). However, unlike other state schools for the deaf, USD had indicated some resistance in adapting and supporting the total communication program fully. They clearly indicated their favoritism in the Oral Program.</p>
		<h3>Bias toward Communication Modes and Methodology</h3>
		<p>While the Total Communication Program was available at the Utah School for the Deaf, many parents continued not to be aware of it. Dr. Grant B. Bitter recruited oral deaf adults and hosted one of several Oral Demonstration Panels at the University of Utah. Dr. Robert Sanderson, Dave Mortensen, Roy Cochran, Kenneth Kinner, and other deaf attendees were present. After the oral deaf adults spoke sharing their experience growing up in an oral environment, Dr. Bitter opened for questions. Dr. Sanderson stood up and asked, “Have you heard the other side of the program?” Dr. Bitter quickly closed the meeting and the audience left without knowing the answer (Kenneth L. Kinner, personal communication, May 14, 2011).</p>
		<p>With ongoing and heated controversy between oral and total communication and parents’ struggle to make decisions based on conflicting advice from Utah School for the Deaf professionals, Dr. Sanderson pointed out that he supported the right of parents of deaf children to decide on a program for them, based on fair information. He opposed improper, biased, one-sided information that lacked research basis (Sanderson, UAD Bulletin, March 1992). One example applied to this situation. A father of a 14 year old met with Dr. Jay J. Campbell in his office at the Utah State Office of Education and expressed his concern about his son being in the oral program and still could not read and write well. He asked Dr. Campbell for his advice. Dr. Campbell asked if he had heard of the other side: Total Communication Program. The father said no; he had never heard of that program (Kenneth L. Kinner, personal communication, May 14, 2011).</p>
		<p>Because of parents’ ignorance of USD programs availability, Dr. Campbell recommended that procedures be established for parent orientation and student placement, with a pamphlet provided that explained the two programs and their different communication methodologies. It was emphasized that this brochure be updated periodically with summaries of empirical research (Campbell, 1977). However, Dr. Bitter objected to the plan. He urged that the total communication was a philosophy, not a method (Dr. Grant B. Bitter, personal communication, February 4, 1985). The plan collapsed.</p>

			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>Over the years, the animosity between Dr. Grant B. Bitter and Dr. Robert G. Sanderson grew. Dr. Bitter frequently hosted an Oral Demonstration Panel at the University of Utah and other locations such as Ogden McKay-Dee Hospital. Whenever Dr. Bitter noticed Dr. Sanderson showed up with his interpreter, Beth Ann Campbell, he would speak fast. He did this on purpose so that Dr. Sanderson would get lost for questioning after the demonstration. Beth didn’t want to see this happening so she managed to sign fast enough to meet the speed of his speech. Dr. Sanderson did not let this stop him from participating so he had to lean down to concentrate on his interpreter and grasp the information. It was successful (Beth Ann Campbell, personal communication, July 1, 2007).</p>

			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>Dr. Grant B. Bitter tended to recruit the deaf oral kids who speak well to his Oral Demonstration Panel at the University of Utah. Instead of using his own daughter, Colleen, he used another girl by the name of Colleen Johnson Jones to demonstrate her speaking ability to the audience several times. Her mother, Legia Johnson felt uneasy and uncomfortable about this situation. She eventually quit her teaching job from the Utah School for the Deaf’s extension program so that Dr. Bitter would not able to use Colleen again (Lisa Roush, personal communication, April 14, 2009).</p>

			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>Georgia H. Walker (USD ’30) published her article on the Deseret News entitled, “Deaf Group Aims Rapped” on June 23, 1970:</p>
			<p>“Recently I attended a meeting of the Oral Deaf Association of Utah at the Miton Bennion Hall at the University of Utah. It was better than a three-ring circus, and just as amusing, and I have been laughing ever since!</p>
			<p>First thing, I am laughing at is the name. Who runs it? Hearing teachers and parents – not the oralists themselves. The Utah Association for the Deaf is run by the deaf themselves, not their parents or teachers.</p>
			<p>Second, 90 percent of the young adults and older students on display can and do use sign language when they know their parents and teachers are not watching.</p>
			<p>Third, one of the students said that she preferred to speak and read lips so that she would be able to get a better job and earn more money than one who couldn’t.</p>
			<p>I have one question: Do employers pay for the ability to speak and read lips, or do they pay for the ability to work? It is my observation that employers would rather that those they employ would shut up and get to work. Of course, speech and lip-reading make things a bit easier but what is wrong with a pencil and paper? At least you get the message correctly. I do know what I am talking about, I am totally deaf and have been for 49 years. I am not belittling the ability to speak and read lips. I acknowledge that life would be harder if I couldn’t do it. But what counts with me is “Education” in capital letters, and I see precious little of it in the oralists I meet up with after they leave school.” – Georgia H. Walker (Walker, Deseret News, June 23, 1970).</p>

		<h3>Lloyd H. Perkins Submits a Letter to the University</h3>
		<p>Lloyd H. Perkins, Chair of the Utah Association for the Deaf’s Education Committee and the Deaf community expressed their concerns about the University of Utah’s decision to not introduce a pedagogical approach known as total communication into the Teacher Preparation Program (L. Perkins, personal communication, no date). The Special Education program strongly believed that deaf students should be educated orally and that sign language should be discouraged.</p>
		<p>Throughout the debate, a new policy was formed to require teachers who prepare to teach all deaf students to master the basic manual communication competencies. However, UAD/Deaf community and Special Education department had a different view regarding the extent to which total communication courses would be offered in the teacher preparation program. The controversy seemed to have quieted down during the year of 1971.</p>
		<p>However, Mr. Lloyd Perkins sent a letter to Alfred C. Emery, University President asking for a review of the Teacher Preparation Program. On December 6, 1971, Dr. Robert Erdman responded to the letter received by President Emery and sent a confidential letter to faculty in the Special Education program calling for discussion of the Teacher Preparation Program during the December 13 meeting (Dr. Erdman, personal communication, December 6, 1971). Dr. Stephen Hencley, Dean of the Graduate School of Education, responded to Mr. Perkins, affirming that there would be changes to the curriculum, incorporating a sign language component to the Teacher Preparation Program (S. Hencley, personal communication, December 16, 1971). Mr. Perkins replied positively to that letter and Dr. Hencley was compelled to reply and reaffirmed support of the changes (S. Hencley, personal communication, January 7, 1972; Jeff Pollock, personal communication, May 4, 2005).</p>
		<h3>Sign Language Instructors Needed in Utah</h3>
		<p>On July 13, 1973, the Utah State Board of Education voted to encourage teaching of both oral and sign language at the Utah School for the Deaf and urged the USD to recruit nationally for sign language teachers. They decided that national recruitment would be more practical than setting up a program in Utah to train teachers in the total communication method. The USD had increased its emphasis in the oral method and that Dr. Jay J. Campbell noted the University of Utah as the only state institution training teacher of the deaf, became graduates in the oral education only (Dean, Deseret News, July 14, 1973).</p>
		<h3>Dr. Jay J. Campbell Asks the University of Utah for a Report</h3>
		<p>On July 23, 1974, Dr. Jay J. Campbell inquired to Dr. Robert L. Erdman for a report ensuring that total communication was being implemented in the Teacher Preparation Program (Dr. Campbell, personal communication, July 23, 1974). Dr. Erdman replied that in 1972, Mr. Gene Stewart was hired to teach a sign language course (SPA 782, Basic Communication and Counseling of Deaf Adults) and a counseling course (SP ED 624, Guidance and Counseling of the Hearing Impaired) as a required component of the Teacher Preparation Program (Dr. personal communication, August 15, 1974).</p>
		<p>Dr. Erdman's letter also included the new policy:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>“All students who are preparing to become teachers of the hearing impaired are required to master the basic manual communication competencies through involvement in one or both of the above described classes or be able to demonstrate those competencies if they have already had previous manual communication experiences and/or coursework in that area” (Dr. Erdman, personal communication, p. 2, August 15, 1974).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>There was, however a divergence of opinions between the view of the Deaf community and the Special Education department regarding the extent to which total communication courses would be offered in the program. Apparently, the Deaf community expected a complete Total Communication program but the University of Utah had not agreed to gear the University deaf education program toward total communication.</p>
		<p>Thus, the University established a Committee to Study Personnel Needs on Programs for the Deaf. In the final report from this committee, one of the conclusions was that establishing a Total Communication program would “not be economically feasible, since new staff would have to be employed and additional administrative costs would be incurred” (Committee to Study Personnel Needs in Programs for the Deaf, p. 3, June 6, 1974).</p>
		<p>The Utah State Board of Education also studied the feasibility of the establishment of a parallel preparation program in total communication and they agreed it was not economically feasible to add a total communication program to the Teacher Preparation Program. It was approved that a sum of money be appropriated to recruit total communication teachers from outside the state. It was also agreed to include some total communication experiences in the oral training program (Committee to Study Personnel Needs in Programs for the Deaf, p. 3, June 6, 1974). The controversy again quieted down from 1974 to 1977 (Jeff Pollock, personal communication, May 4, 2005).</p>
		<h3>Utah’s Unique Dual System </h3>
		<p>Since the establishment of the dual track system at the Utah School for the Deaf in 1962, they called it unique because it claimed the sole ownership of two programs of instruction, one using the Oral Approach and the other using the Total Communication Approach. President David Mortensen of the Utah Association for the Deaf had a different perspective of its educational system. In the UAD Bulletin, June 1975, he questioned the word “unique” and wondered if it meant “good.”</p>
		<p>On December 28, 1970, the Utah State Board of Education adopted a policy for the USD, in part which say, “Students in Oral and Total Communication program conducted at the School and its students who attend public schools shall be separated through the junior high school years.” In the view of President Mortensen, it had been assumed that segregation had all but been abolished by the United States federal government or at least trying to abolish it. Yet the Utah State Board of Education chose to remain distant from any U.S. government policy and maintained a devastating policy of segregation for the deaf in the residential and day class schools.</p>
			<p>According to the UAD Bulletin, June 1975, President Mortensen felt the dual track system was a double standard, whether they were concerned with and if practiced along side each other, cause confusion and distraction. He listed the following examples to get better a perspective of the double standard within the system at the USD:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Law making with a Democratic Congress and a Republican President</li>
			<li>Religious stability with children of a Mormon father and a Catholic mother – each parent doing his/her best to convince the children of his/her religious beliefs.</li>
			<li>School spirit on a campus with a dual track system where free communication is retrained</li>
			<li>Business success of a company with two presidents each having opposite marketing and management philosophies.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>As quoted from the UAD Bulletin and summarized by President Mortensen, a recent research study of children of divorced couples showed that those children whose parent did not remarry had better mental health and showed far less emotional problems than those children whose parent did remarry. The Bible states, “No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despite the other.” With regard to the above statement, when a divorced mother with children remarries, the children find themselves with two fathers – the real one and the substitute. If things go as they generally do, the children become confused as to which father they “should” love and obey the most; thus the reason for more emotional problems and less than good mental health. The children soon hold more to the one and despise the other and at the same time feel pangs of guilt. This dual track life is unhealthy. The child whose parent does not remarry does not engage in the problem of serving two tracks, therefore, better mental health and less frustration.</p>
		<h3>It Has Much To Do with Status</h3>
		<p>President Mortensen believed that it had much to do with status. In a Dual Track educational system, in his view, a student who has a degree of status is placed in the same track program that is enthusiastically supported by the school’s administration. In other words, he has a higher rank than a student in the “other track” program. Because he has the administration “on his side,” he feels a degree of prestige and pride that he may not otherwise feel if he were in the “other track” program.</p>
		<p>In order to comprehend the meaning of status behind it, President Mortensen gave an example about the TV commercials giving their products status. While marketing their products, “___ out of 10 TV repairmen buy Zenith TV’s;” and, “8 out of 10 doctors recommended Anacin!” The status is the fact that you buy a TV that most TV repairmen buy; you take the Anacin because more doctors recommend it. When a man buys a Rolls Royce, he buys with it a great deal of status – after all, not very many men can afford a $35,000 car. There are a few examples given by President Mortensen to consider that were meaningful and important to people and some status symbols that give or would give people ego a big boost: 1. a new car, 2. a college degree, 3. Friends, 4. Clothes, 5. Money, 6. a good Job, 7. a muscular or shapely body, 8 a title (president, queen, chairman, etc), 9. a truck and camper, 10. a big new house, 11. Lots of books (shows you are smart).</p>
		<p>President Mortensen’s examples showed that status can be many things and possibly different for each person. However, he stated that one thing is certain, status is important to every human being. He then questioned, “What would we be if we didn’t work for or strive toward the attainment of status?” The answer – if we didn’t work or strive toward – something- we would be more or less driving toward lifelessness, death, and mental and physical destruction.</p>
		<p>Based on President Mortensen’s observation of the history precedence and his perception to the testimony of former oral students, he gave an example contemplating the above list of status symbols. The circumstance of an oral student attending a residential school for the deaf where the administration is strongly oral, who has just been told by school officials that although he has been in the oral track for 13 years, he hasn’t been successful and should be transferred to the manual track program. Imagine how this young man feels. He has been in the oral department for 13 years and has learned to appreciate the following status symbols: 1.Good speech, 2. Speech reading, 3. Hearing, 4. Integration, 5. Understanding hearing people, 6. Never signing or gesturing, 7. Going to a public school, 8. Having a hearing girl or boy friend.</p>
		<p>Now that student is suddenly going into that “other track” program. The side that the administration put all the failures and multiply disabled in – the side his parents never wanted him to be in! The side that gives status to deafness by saying it’s good to be attending a school for the deaf – it doesn’t matter if you have good speech, you’ve got other good qualities. It’s OK to sign and gesture because we know how much speech reading is poor at best and it’s OK if you are totally deaf and have a girl friend who is also deaf; and it’ll be OK to sign openly now instead of in secret all the time – WOW! What a bunch of churning emotions!</p>
		<p>President Mortensen agreed that a Dual Track system of education was unique, but he disagreed that it was good. He thought perhaps that was why there were only one or two such programs in the whole United States. He was concerned about deaf people looking for acceptance. Deaf people had a hard enough time being deaf let alone trying to be deaf and hearing – hearing because parents, teachers, administrators, audiologists, speech therapists, relatives and many others keep telling them they can hear, they can understand, they can lipread, they can talk, they can integrate; when in fact, they can’t! President Mortensen argued that in fact, deaf people were proud to be deaf. Their status wasn’t just through speech and integration, but pride in other things they can do better than hearing people – they’ll never be able to talk better.</p>
		<p>Lastly, President Mortensen stated that at this time, students in “the other track” program are a minority within a minority and gaining status and favor from an oral administration is rather difficult! He noticed the Dual Track system caused animosity – a feeling of strong dislike between the Oral and Total Communication programs (Mortensen, UAD Bulletin, June 1975).</p>

			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>One day in 1975, Roy Cochran (USD ’61), a deaf father of two deaf children, Don and Lisa, visited the Utah School for the Deaf and ran into Superintendent Robert W. Tegeder. Robert knew sign language and asked Roy to come into his office for a chat, which he did. Robert admitted to Roy that he missed Roy’s old time where there was no controversy over the communication methodologies (Roy Cochran, personal communication, May 5, 2011).</p>
		</aside>
		<h3>Mainstreaming and Least Restrictive Environment</h3>
		<p>The Utah School for the Deaf became a leader of mainstreaming classes through the Extension Divisions during the 1960s, before the term became popular with the passing in 1975 of Public Law 94-142, now known as Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and Utah’s trend towards mainstreaming grew steadily in the education of deaf children (Baldwin, 1990). Dr. Jay J. Campbell observed that much of the emphasis for mainstreaming came from the University of Utah and Dr. Grant B. Bitter (Campbell, 1977). Dr. Bitter argued that residential schools were too isolated from society, and advocated for day schools and classes in public schools (Baldwin, 1990).</p>
		<p>Despite this argument, many other educators and parents expressed great concern about IDEA and were fearful that USD as a “special school” would soon be lost in Utah (Campbell, 1977). Dr. Campbell further stated, “The residential school is essential and should not be closed. There are many students who can best be served in special schools, and they would not receive an adequate education in the local districts. The residential school and local districts need to cooperate in the overall program and students need to be evaluated and placed where their needs will best be served” (p. 142).</p>
		<p>Nevertheless, Public 94-142 passed by the United State Congress was a powerful movement for mainstreaming children with disabilities, including deaf children into public school classrooms. This law impacted the decision-making process of educational placement for deaf and hard of hearing students in Utah and mainstreaming became the term most often used to describe the placement of the students: in general education classrooms and/or public schools. As now mandated by law, students were to be placed in the “least restrictive environment.” In fact, Section 612 (5) [later renamed as IDEA 2004 612(a)(5)(A)] states,</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>“...special classes, special schooling, or other removal of handicapped children from the regular educational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the handicap is such that education in regular classes, with the use of supplementary aides and services, cannot be achieved satisfactory” (p. 1).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>With this in mind, Dr. Richard C. Brill, hearing Superintendent of California School for the Deaf, Riverside stated in Campbell’s 1977 Education of the Deaf in Utah, A Comprehensive Study, that the term “least restrictive environment” was generally thought of in terms of physical barriers or physical placement – such a concept assumes that if one is physically placed within a group that automatically the individual is part of the group (p.2). He further pointed out that “communication and psychological relatedness were essential for integration or lack of restriction in the environment” (p.2). Lastly, Brill clarified that “because a child is placed in a regular classroom with many other children rather than in a special class, it does not mean that this child is automatically in a LRE (p. 3). In support of this last statement, Siegel (2000) stated that under IDEA most environments that are communication-rich, and therefore fundamentally “least restrictive” for deaf and hard of hearing children, have no legal imprimatur (p.18).</p>
		<p>Additionally, Thomas (1986) states, “PL 94-142 apparently supports mainstreaming, but it does not support quality of education or a rich language and social environment, factors which mainstream program directors neither understand nor feel compelled to consider” (p. 16). Public Law 94-142 required the school settings to allow deaf and hard of hearing students to be educated as appropriate in the LRE. However, this law did not satisfactorily define “restrictive.”</p>
		<h3>Is Mainstreaming the Deaf Really Justified?</h3>
		<p>In fact, mainstreaming had been controversial since the end of the Civil War, not necessarily since the 1965 and 1971 Education Acts that where strengthened by the 1974 Amendments, leading to the 1975 Public Law 94-142 (Baldwin, 1990). According to Baldwin (1990), a precedent for the mainstreaming programs known today was set in 1852 by David Ely Barlett who opened “Mr. Barlett’s Family School for Young Deaf-Mute Children” in New York City. This was America’s first integrated school with both deaf and hearing students (p. 14). Other schools followed, and during the 1920’s, integration into public schools probably increased rapidly (Baldwin, 1990).</p
		><p>When the U.S. Congress passed the amended Handicapped Act of 1974, they did not consult the National Association of the Deaf or deaf citizens. Dr. Baldwin felt the whole basic Act was downright discrimination (Baldwin, The Utah Eagle, April 1975).</p>
		<p>Dr. Baldwin explained in his “Mainstreaming in Retrospect” article that Alexander Graham Bell, Sarah Fuller, Robert C. Spencer, Grant B. Bitter, and other advocates of day school and classes in the public schools argued that residential schools were too isolated from society. They strongly espoused hard-core oralism and attacked against the conventional residential schools and the popular use of sign language (1990, p. 14). They asserted their educational and philosophical viewpoint by gaining ignorant legislative support assuming on better preparation of the deaf and hard of hearing students to live in the oral/aural English-speaking society, also known as the mainstream of “normal” daily living. The Deaf community arose to the occasion and it became the American method war, which led to the establishment of the National Association of the Deaf in 1880 (Baldwin, 1990). This situation applies to the Utah Association for the Deaf when several representatives such as Dr. Robert G. Sanderson, Dave Mortensen, and Lloyd H. Perkins engaged in heated battles with Dr. Bitter who went the extra mile in promoting oralism and mainstreaming in the state of Utah.</p>
		<p>In 1975, a Deaf individual, Dr. Baldwin, a former husband of Celia May Laramie and a Curriculum Coordinator of the Total Communication Division at the Utah School for the Deaf and the extension program in three different cities, observed many books and articles pertaining to the mainstreaming of deaf children offers highly optimistic justifications, which in his opinion were misleading and refutable. He became concerned with the mainstream advocates attempts the normalization of the educational life of all deaf students, that justifies a critical look. He questioned, “Can such as assertion as providing a normalizing mainstreaming setting be truly justified in view of the whole matter (Baldwin, The Utah Eagle, April 1975)?</p>
		<p>Moreover, Dr. Baldwin observed that the mainstream advocator, particularly the integration specialist for the deaf, had a great vision of programming the deaf students in the public schools in various degrees. As a consequence, the deaf will talk, behave, think and act like a normal hearing person. He wondered why the Deaf community wasn’t asked for their input. He even asked, “Has the mainstream advocator ever tried standing on a soap box in front of the deaf at their club meeting, Frat meeting, or state association meeting” (Baldwin, The Utah Eagle, April 1975)?</p>
		<p>Additionally, Dr. Baldwin asked why the Deaf adults did not participate in the decision-making process to contribute their insightful input. For instance, in February 1975 at a Utah Association for the Deaf workshop, Dr. Baldwin asked 48 deaf adults who were products of residential schools, day schools, and hearing schools, whether they were orally or manually taught, if they would favor mainstreaming. 40 of them were opposed to mainstreaming, 4 supported it and 4 were undecided. Those 40 respondents gave common reasons such as considering residential schools for more valuable and reliable in comparison with the public schools. They doubted the educational and social value of mainstreaming. They “cursed” the mainstream educators for not bothering to solicit their opinions, feelings and suggestions of the deaf people themselves (Baldwin, The Utah Eagle, April 1975).</p>
		<p>Since Public Law 94-142 was enacted in 1975, most of the mainstream educators’ prime concern was “today’s students” and they disregarded how the “former” students were taught in the past. The educators prepared with the high visionary ideas of how the deaf students should be educated in a mainstream setting. Dr. Baldwin expressed his concerns that such daring idealistic thinking was prone to produce risky consequences when Deaf adults were not invited to contribute their insightful input. He felt the experience of the Deaf adults can truly contribute toward the betterment of the education of the deaf. He believed they can provide the necessary feedback on the various types of program that had educated them. Dr. Baldwin urged with their suggestions and recommendations for a better education, much can be gained for the benefit of the educational future of the younger deaf. He observed that despite a state having its own deaf advisory board or committees, several controversial issues had materialized without the deaf’s approval. He believed that it would not be possible to bypass the alumni for the sake of educating the alumni of the future. He urged that formulating the plans for mainstreaming the deaf, thinking the lives of the deaf will be normalized was a grave error (Baldwin, The Utah Eagle, April 1975).</p>
		<p>There was another reason why Dr. Baldwin had doubted the justifications of mainstreaming the deaf. He pointed out in the view of deaf student’s educational, social, mental and emotional needs, will he be thoroughly happy in a demanding environment such as public school educational, social, mental and emotional needs. He observed the school failed when such a criterion in meeting those human needs was not fully fulfilled. He cautioned that not all the public school teachers were professional qualified to encounter the problems of teaching the deaf. Dr. Baldwin was alarmed to discover that it was not uncommon for them to escape responsibility and reality by giving “out of pity” grades. He had met several former mainstreamed deaf students who had received undeserving grades. While visiting public schools where the deaf students were mainstreamed, he found those students in a homogeneous group by themselves; they were clinging to each other socially and emotionally. He became concerned that in lieu of social adjustment, the mainstream advocators were not painting an accurate picture (Baldwin, The Utah Eagle, April 1975).</p>
		<p>On a side note, Dr. Baldwin believed the parents were being used as the “crutch” when mainstream proponents usually said parents wish to have their child mainstreamed. In regards to such as intriguing point, he wondered if the parents were familiar with the potential pitfalls in the concept of mainstreaming. Dr. Baldwin also questioned concerning parents being told fairly about the advantages and disadvantages of mainstreaming. In his opinion, some of the parents had simply fallen for highly idealistic educational goals that had not been endorsed by the deaf people or a majority of leading educators of the deaf. Dr. Baldwin as a Total Communication Coordinator had seen and talked to parents who expected so much for the “wealth” of mainstreaming that they enhanced their false hopes for a “normal” deaf child while not actually noticing the education strangulation of the child (Baldwin, The Utah Eagle, April 1975)</p>
		<p>In a particular school district, Dr. Baldwin noted that when an alert special educator recognized that academic failing of the mainstreamed deaf student, they usually took quick action before the educational damage was done. In most cases the deaf student was either placed in a self-contained class or put in a state residential school for the deaf. However, some mainstream educators were strongly opposed to second alternative – residential school for the deaf. Dr. Baldwin observed that they seemed to hide behind the cloak of sheer dislike for residential schools for the deaf. Instead, mainstreamed advocators continued to magnify the justifications of mainstreaming, all along thinking they can sound the death knoll for residential school. Evidently, the educational deaths were taking place in the public schools. “How is that for irony?” he asked (Baldwin, The Utah Eagle, April 1975).</p>
		<p>After leaving the Horace Mann School, one of the first true preparatory day schools for mainstream integration in 1956, Dr. Baldwin became fully “integrated in the public schools for seven years (Baldwin, 1990). Although he excelled academically and athletically with no support services, he experienced missing essential intangible qualities such as emotional gratification, completely acceptance and fully comprehends his deafness on the part of his hearing classmates and teachers. He said his mainstreaming was really a sad experience in terms of education and human relationships. Because of his experience, he did not personally consider mainstreaming a most desirable educational opportunity for a great number of deaf children. It took Dr. Baldwin 30 years for soul searching. He advised not to wait three more decades to feel the same way about mainstreaming, whether you are a deaf or hearing person. He encouraged asking a deaf adult’s opinion and feeling without soliciting, take it or leave it. He felt the educational life we save may be that of our very own child (Baldwin, The Utah Eagle, April 1975; Baldwin, 1990).</p>
		<p>Consequently, Dr. Baldwin’s article, “Is Mainstreaming the Hearing Impaired Really Justified?” published in the April 1975 Utah Eagle magazine, caused a controversy among parents who enrolled their children in mainstream classes. Robert W. Tegeder, USDB Superintendent stood by him when he announced that parents should know both sides of a controversial issue. In Dr. Baldwin’s article, he basically cautioned that mainstreaming should not be taken totally for granted. He felt that placing every deaf and hard of hearing student in the public school should be considered carefully. Furthermore, he asked, “Why weren’t the opinions, feelings, and suggestions of the deaf honestly solicited by mainstream educators (Baldwin, 1990, p. 17).</p>
		<p>15 years later in 1990, Dr. Baldwin had not received a satisfactory answer as to why the deaf students of the day and residential settings, be it Oral or Total Communication programs, experience life in the public schools in various degrees, were not asked to participant in the decision-making process. Since 1975, the mainstream classes grew rapidly to meet parents’ wishes to have their children mainstreamed as well as to “normalize” them in the educational life – learn to talk, behave, think and act like a normal hearing person (Campbell, 1977; Baldwin, 1990).</p>
		<p>Prior to 1975, a deaf student, regardless of speech usage or auditory ability, the only criterion to enter the public schools were excellent social skills, above reading average, and good writing skills. Dr. Baldwin observed in an irony sense that after the PL 94-142 was enacted, the oral advocates believed the oral students should be blended into a public school setting and a total communication goal of combining both signs and speech (Baldwin, 1990). Richard Stoker (1990), Director of Central Institute for the Deaf, a private oral school in St. Louis supported Dr. Baldwin’s concern. Richard clarified that “mainstreaming doesn’t make you ‘normal,’ whatever that is.” He emphasized that children should be placed into society to an extent they can handle, but parents should not try to force them into mainstream society as children may either sink or swim in a mainstream setting. He even suggested that children should be exposed to whatever aspects of society they can deal with (Williams, 1990).</p>
		<h3>Total Communication and the Deaf Teacher</h3>
		<p>In April 1976, Dr. Robert G. Sanderson wrote an article entitled “Total Communication and the Deaf Teacher” and published it in the <em>UAD Bulletin</em>. He asserted that the concept of Total Communication for teaching deaf children was sometimes used as a plan or a scheme to discriminate against deaf teachers or deaf candidates for a teacher training program. He understood that there was always room for interpretation. However, he expressed his concern about Dr. David Denton suggesting that speech would be a part of every teacher’s repertoire in every class and in every subject in the Total Communication program. Dr. Sanderson pointed out that when the child is ready for speech, he should be given the very best speech instruction available taught by a speech teacher only, rather than by a teacher who teaches math, geography, or history. He felt that giving a speech lesson to a child during a history class was to weaken (dilute) both. He stated that a deaf teacher, by the same token, shouldn’t be expected to teach speech if the child prefers to stick with algebra, social science or chemistry.</p>
		<p>In regard to the teacher training programs that emphasized speech, Dr. Sanderson felt that it was vital to learn how to teach subjects and develop knowledge in theories and psychology and to develop the ability to communicate in sign language for the development of language competence in children who are primarily visually oriented.</p>
		<p>Dr. Sanderson noticed that there were still those who despise deaf teachers. He felt it was a curious contradiction that so many people who have deaf children appear to dislike deafness and deaf adults, little realizing that their children will quickly grow into adulthood and, people being rather much alike, exhibit the same or similar characteristics of present-day deaf adults. It was also curious that those who do not wish for a deaf teacher to teach their own child may someday find their own youth wanting to go to college to learn to be a teacher of the deaf! Or a psychologist in a school for the deaf, or a social worker, or...</p>
		<p>In essence, Dr. Sanderson felt the deaf teacher had a strong role to play in any school for deaf children. The deaf teacher should be a model for the children, someone they can identify with. He also clarified that Total Communication means that every mode and means of communication shall be available to a child when he needs it and wants it. He can be and should be encouraged to develop his speech. Forcing it upon him when he neither wants it nor is ready for it is bad psychology and leads to resistance and later problems. According to the Deaf community at that time, they were all for the development of speech and they recognized its value. However, they were very much against the use of force – intimidation, anger, physical violence, or punishment – in whatever guise, in the teaching of speech, whether in Oral or Total Communication program.</p>
		<p>In regards to physical punishment as mentioned earlier, on November 12, 1970, the Utah State Board of Education moved to keep the students in Oral and Total Communication programs separate through junior high school reinforcing the basic practices of lip-reading, auditory training, and physical punishment (Jeff Pollock, personal communication, May 4, 2005). Physical punishment was in form of the students being forced to sit on their hands. If the students were caught signing, their hands were slapped with a ruler. Dr. Sanderson argued it was a poor teaching practice. The Deaf community had no respect for such teachers, or administrators who permitted it or parents who condoned it. They believed that children learn best when they are relaxed and happy (Sanderson, UAD Bulletin, April 1976).</p>
		<p>(Note: Other forms of punishment the students experienced when caught signing at Utah School for the Deaf included teacher throwing a piece of chalk, putting soap in the student’s mouth, putting student’s head in a toilet bowl, taking away lunch, and bending down the ear.)</p>
		<h3>Changes Occur in the Gallaudet’s TRIPOD Parent Association of the Deaf</h3>
		<p>Since the establishment of Parent-Teacher-Student Association in 1970, parents and some of the officers from Utah Association for the Deaf met for a meeting. In 1976, the Parent-Teacher-Student Association became Gallaudet’s TRIPOD Parent Association of the Deaf so that Gallaudet College could assist Utah in improving quality of deaf education. Kenneth L. Kinner became president and Carol Mathis became vice president. The members took their turn driving to the meeting in Salt Lake City and Ogden every three month (Kenneth L. Kinner, personal communication, May 14, 2011).</p>
		<p>In late 1976, the TRIPOD members proposed for a split due to long commutes to the meeting and voted to split into two: the Salt Lake TRIPOD, and the Ogden TRIPOD. Each had its own elections. Results were:</p>
		<p>Salt Lake TRIPOD: President, Carol Mathis; 1st Vice President, Bea Lang; 2nd Vice President, Steve Baldwin; 3rd Vice President, Pat Prischak; 4th Vice President, Nora Snarr; Secretary, Shaunna DeWaal; Treasurer, John Mathis; Historian, Connie MacKay.</p>
		<p>Ogden TRIPOD: President, Kenneth Kinner; 1st Vice President, Darlene Cochran; 2nd Vice President, Steve Baldwin; 3rd Vice President, Jean Welling; Secretary, Margaret Gale; Treasurer, Carol Atkinson; Parliamentarian, Don Jensen (UAD Bulletin, December 1976; Kenneth L. Kinner, personal communication, May 14, 2011).</p>
		<p>Both PTSA organizations continued to be active until 1980s. Over the years, mainstreaming grew steadily and public schools had their own PTA where the parents in general could participate. In addition, some of the officers’ deaf children either graduated from Utah School for the Deaf or transferred to a residential school outside of the state or transfer to a neighborhood public school, Gallaudet’s TRIPOD eventually fizzled out. It was the same for the oral extension PTA because the majority of oral children were placed in a public school where it had its own PTA (Kenneth L. Kinner, personal communication, May 14, 2011).</p>
		<h3>C. Roy Cochran Speaks Up</h3>
		<p>In March of 1976, C. Roy Cochran was appointed to serve on the Self-Study and Advisory Committee representing as a parent. However, on November 17, 1976, he resigned from this committee due to the issues that he didn’t agree with. Roy wrote:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Dear Dr. Bitter and Members of the Self-Study Advisory Committee,</p>
			<p>I do not wish to stay on the Committee any longer. May I list the reasons why I am leaving the Committee for good:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The U. of U. program for teachers of the deaf is ORAL and will always be ORAL as long as Dr. Bitter is there;</li>
				<li>All the course requirements for those in deaf education concentrate heavily on speech, speechreading and auditory training. Yes, they are important but not at the expense other important subjects like science, history, and so on;</li>
				<li>The Board of Regents may wish the U. of U. to have a Total Communication in a small way such as the sign language or a course under Dr. Sanderson, but the program under Dr. Bitter IS strongly ORAL/URAL. UNFAIR!</li>
				<li>Dr. Bitter is a nationally known ORAL advocator and an active Alexander Graham Bell Officer. In Utah, most of the deaf adults believed in Total Communication for most deaf children. So Dr. Bitter is one of the symbols of Oralism in Utah and his program at U. of U. will always be ORAL/AURAL. If I must make recommendations, then I would first change the whole program inside down and make it a real Total Communication program. But again I say, I am wasting my time, as long as Dr. Bitter is here. (Mr. Baldwin may wish to make some recommendations and I wish him luck).</li>
				<li>Mrs. Dorothy Young is a friend of mine. She is deaf and an active member of the Salt Lake Valley Ward for the Deaf. Recently she dropped out of the U. of U. program where she hoped to receive her teacher’s certification in the education of the deaf. While I may not have all the details as to why she left from Dr. Bitter’s point of view, I can only say that the U. of U. is NO fair place for a deaf person or a hearing person who wants to be a real Total Communication teacher. DR. BITTER IS KNOWN TO OPPOSE THE DEAF COMMUNITY AND THEIR ACTIVITES. Furthermore, Oral deaf adults do NOT speak for the real Deaf community. Mrs. Young is living proof of most of my reasons for leaving the Committee.</li>
				<li>Recently I learned that West Jordan school where is private controlling by Dr. Bitter. These deaf children are vegetation. I am leaving in very good conscience. It is not worth my efforts or time.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Sincerely,</p>
			<p>Charles Roy Cochran<br>Representative of a Parent Whose Children are enrolled in Total Communication at US</p>
			<p>(C. Roy Cochran, personal communication, November 17, 1976)</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Dr. Bitter responded to Roy’s letter on December 3, 1976 saying it was most unfortunate that he resigned from the Self-Study Committee when his input was very much needed and desired. He clarified the Dorothy L. Young case regarding her request for renewal of certification and her desire to enroll in classes at the University to help her achieve that goal. Dorothy was totally deaf and a former teacher of the Utah School for the Deaf from 1960 to 1967. She formally held the old provisional deaf credential, which expired in 1968. She held secondary certification valid until 1981. In order to be credentialed again to teach the deaf, she had to meet the current requirements. However, Dr. Bitter explained that he was concerned about potential difficulty that Dorothy might experience in the teacher training program because of her limited oral communication skills and the interpreter’s inability to convey the needed information. Dr. Bitter further explained that after much discussion with him, Dr. David R. Byrne, Assistant Dean of College of Education, and Jeannette Misaka, Clinical Instructor, Dorothy had decided not to pursue her work toward renewal of her certification in November 1976, which disappointed her (G.B. Bitter, personal communication, December 3, 1976).</p>
		<p>Dr. Bitter said his interests and concerns were for equal rights and opportunities for all who have differences. He shared that one of the goals of the teacher education program in the Area of the Deaf at the University of Utah was to provide the opportunity for student teachers to develop basic skills in manual communication and to have considerable involvement with the Deaf community in order to develop manual competence and increase understanding and tolerance among people. He defended Roy’s comment about being opposed the Deaf community. He pointed out that Gene Stewart, a director of the Utah Community Center for the Deaf taught Special Education 580 course and students were encouraged to also take the course which Dr. Robert G. Sanderson taught SPA 789 course. Furthermore, he clarified that he had no private control over any school. He said if he did, Roy can be assured that children would not be “vegetating” (G.B. Bitter, personal communication, December 3, 1976).</p>
		<p>Lastly, Dr. Bitter informed Roy that he might like to reconsider his decision to not serve any longer on the Committee and that he was cordially invited to attend the next meeting on December 17th (G.B. Bitter, personal communication, December 3, 1976).</p>
		<p>Roy reconsidered and returned to the final meeting in completion of the task.
		Roy cannot remember what the task was. After he enrolled his deaf children, Don and Lisa at the Model Secondary School for the Deaf in Washington, D.C. , where they could get better education and peers in the 1980s, he had his bitter battle against the oralism forgotten and moved forward with his life (Roy Cochran, personal interview, April 22, 2011).</p>
		<h3>Utah Association for the Deaf Appeals for Better Education</h3>
		<p>Despite the policy being enacted in 1970 giving the parents of deaf children choices, totalists and oralists had been at war for several years as to the best method of teaching a deaf child (Salt Lake Tribune, February 19, 1977).</p>
		<p>While Dave Mortensen was president of the Utah Association for the Deaf, more than 100 deaf people who represented the UAD appealed for improvement in education for deaf children were packed at the Utah State Board of Education in Salt Lake City on February 18, 1977 (Salt Lake Tribune, February 19, 1977). Dr. Robert G. Sanderson, a Coordinator of Services for the Deaf was a spokesman to the board where he said, “Tomorrow’s world, with is incredible technological advances even over the vast changes we see today, will require even more education for deaf people to compete in the market place jobs” (Salt Lake Tribune, February 19, 1977).</p>
		<p>While speaking for the UAD group, Dr. Sanderson also said, “As we look around us at the world and at the millions of people who hear and speak normally, we note that it is not their speech but their education that enables them to achieve” (Cummins, Salt Lake Tribune, February 19, 1977, B5).</p>
		<p>Dr. Sanderson said the UAD group had been concerned about the quality of education and made three recommendations to the board, as follows:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<ul>
				<li>The Utah School for the Deaf at Ogden should be divided into two separate schools, one for total communication and one for oral communication. The suggested that the total communication should be located on the present Ogden campus, and another site be found for the seconds chook. Conflicts in philosophy and teaching approach were given as reasons for the division.</li>
				<li>Each deaf child should be evaluated by a professional team, which would recommend a specific program for the deaf.</li>
				<li>The state board should develop a long-range research program to determine needs and the best method of instruction for deaf children (Salt Lake Tribune, February 19, 1977).</li>
			</ul>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Dr. Sanderson expressed his concerns that the normal deaf students graduated from high school with reading levels ranging from 1st grade functionally illiterate to 5th or 6th grade. He urged the board to place more emphasis on reading, writing and arithmetic, so that the rest of the curriculum can be absorbed and understood. He said the most important element to a deaf person’s advancement is education, and speech is the only one of the many subjects a child needs in his education. Dr. Sanderson emphasized the importance of the ability to understand, use, and apply the three R’s is 10,000 times more important to a deaf person than the mere ability to speak (Salt Lake Tribune, February 19, 1977).</p>
		<p>Lastly, Dr. Sanderson said, “The use of sign language does not retard nor prevent the development of speech. A deaf person will not lose his speech if he learns sign language, and it is a big lie, a monstrous falsehood and deliberate deceit to tell anxious parents otherwise (Cummins, Salt Lake Tribune, February 19, 1977, B5).</p>
		<h3>The State of Utah Aide Indicts Utah School for the Deaf</h3>
		<p>On March 17, 1977, a scathing indictment of the Utah School for the Deaf in Ogden was voiced by Gene Stewart, Rehabilitation counselor for the deaf who endorsed the total communication philosophy before the Utah State Board of Education meeting in Moab, Utah. He, as a hearing son of deaf parents, Wayne and Georgie Mae (Bass) Stewart charged USD for providing inadequate training on deaf children’s education. He reported to the board on a nationwide model program for the deaf and said Utah already had a program to identify and diagnose the needs of deaf persons, but the state facility falls short in educating the young. Gene backed Dr. Robert G. Sanderson up from the previous State Board meeting by saying, “Very few deaf children go on to college. In fact, practically none, and by the time I get them at the postsecondary level they won’t have anything to do with any more schooling.” He added, “We keep turning them out up there, and yet they don’t even know the language of English.” While Gene read letters from deaf pupils demonstrating their lack of language training, he asked, “How can you read lips if you don’t know the words, or how can you learn to write English if you don’t know the language?” He denounced the program at the Ogden main campus, which continued to turn out children who were unable to understand English. Gene declared, “There is something wrong with the system.” The Board accepted the report as an information item (Deseret News, March 18, 1977).</p>
		<h3>Method of Teaching Deaf Students Stir Debate</h3>
		<p>On March 25, 1977, Robert W. Tegeder, superintendent of the Utah School for the Deaf responded to Gene Stewart’s charge in the Utah State Board of Education saying that students on the Ogden campus are shifted from one teaching method to the other because the two educational philosophies are fighting. In addition, he said, “the ultimate decision to teach deaf children oral or total communication methods belongs to the parents.” Gene said, “The philosophy of the school is oral. If the kid fails the oral program they will shift him to the other.” He also said, “We ‘re living in the dark ages in Utah. Many schools throughout the nation are using the total communication concept alone” Superintendent Tegeder said the charge that the school’s philosophy is oral “simply can’t be substantiated.” He said, “Kids have been shifted from oral to total, but that is natural when a child is not progressing in the oral program. If his speech is not developing satisfactorily he is shifted to where emphasis is less on speech.” He added that the total concept is “hard to define because there’s never really been an agreement as to how much total includes” (Ogden Standard-Examiner, March 16, 1977).</p>
		<p>The State Board was considering establishing two campuses, one for each teaching method. They had heard Dr. Robert G. Sanderson and Gene Stewart’s presentation endorsing the total communication philosophy. The board meeting was scheduled in April to hear from the backers of the oral philosophy (Ogden Standard-Examiner, March 16, 1977).</p>
		<h3>Dr. Jay J. Campbell’s <em>Education of the Deaf in Utah, A Comprehensive Study</em></h3>
		<p>On April 14, 1977, Dr. Jay J. Campbell, associate superintendent of public instruction prepared a 200 page report on educating the deaf and gave a presentation to the Utah State Board of Education at the Utah School for the Deaf (Ogden Standard-Examiner, April 15, 1977).</p>
		<p>Dr. Campbell, an ally of the Deaf community, was appointed by Utah State Office of Education to supervise the Utah School for the Deaf in 1966. During his supervision, he observed the constant controversy between Dr. Grant B. Bitter and Dr. Robert G. Sanderson as well as controversy between the two programs at USD over communication methodology. In order to strengthen the USD programs, he began a study on deaf education in 1975, which was authorized by Utah State Board of Education (Campbell, 1977; Dr. Jay J. Campbell, personal communication, July 1, 2007).</p>
		<p>The comprehensive study was created by the Utah State Board of Education, Office of Administration and Institutional Services to discuss new ways to strengthen programs for the deaf in Utah. The students would address the gap between training at the Utah School for the Deaf and training for Utah adult deaf and encourage both groups be mutually supportive and viable. The report included summary and analysis of evaluative research on communication methods used in educating the deaf, a study of deaf children in Utah school districts, a sample of opinions of parents of older students at the Utah School for the Deaf. The input from the professional staff, letters and materials received from national leaders and educators of the deaf were provided. The perceptions and recommendations from former students, professional interpreters of the deaf, and professional counselors of the deaf were also included. The report made policy recommendations for USD (Campbell, 1977).</p>
		<p>After two years of comprehensive study and having worked with outside, neutral researchers, Dr. Campbell finished the report on February 15, 1977. The results were based on data gathered between 1960 and 1977 and included those being mainstreamed in the school districts and those under the auspices of the Utah School for the Deaf. The report basically indicated the educational achievement had been poor due to conflict between the two philosophies of educating the deaf students. Additionally, the child’s needs had been lost in the controversy over philosophies. The aides and tutors were in short supply at USD; teachers felt burdened teaching children with different ages, languages, and cognitive skills in one classroom. One teacher expressed it this way: “In most classes, there is a marked difference in ability levels between students. Often a teacher must teach at two or more different levels at the same time. A competent aide can help the teacher to utilize the student’s time efficiently by carrying out certain instructional activities with part of the class while the teacher instructs other students. Besides increasing the actual amount of instruction time for teaching students, utilization of aide personnel can also increase the amount of language input received by each student during the day” (Campbell, 1977, p. 78). Many deaf students were not prepared to earn a living and did not have the basic skills necessary to function adequately in the society. It was suggested that early intervention of the education of the deaf was needed. Not only that, it was difficult for USD to provide quality education because the percentage of children with additional disabilities had increased over the years. In many cases, the school districts did not have the commitment or the trained personnel to do the job adequately. Moreover, the school districts were not educating deaf children adequately. Interaction between deaf and hearing students was limited. It was found that deaf students were happier and better adjusted if they had other deaf students to associate with (Campbell, 1977).</p>
		<p>In the study, Dr. Campbell quoted a letter from one respondent because, in his judgment, it had significant observation and recommendations.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>After observing the “two track system” as used by the Utah School for the Deaf, I believe its operation offers Utah the greatest flexibility in individualization and yet its operation creates intense inhouse and instate strife that significantly impairs the effectiveness of the school.</p>
			<p>I believe that a state that offers only one communicative system for all deaf children is denying children the MOST important educational alternative that a deaf child needs. There is no question that there is a loss of potential and a great deal of inappropriate placement of deaf children when only one communicative system is offered. I would strongly support the continuation of a two track system if the internal and external strife can be eliminated. However, at this point, I believe the strife has reached catastrophic stages and the whole education process is endangered.</p>
			<p>I would like to first point out what I feel to be the source of this strife, then the results of the strife and last some suggestions for dealing with the problem.</p>
			<p>I believe the source of the strife is in two completely separate programs. Each program has its own dean, its own supervisor, its own teachers, students, parents and of course supporters and enemies.</p>
			<p>Strife is inherent in such program division. Each program is threatened by the other and when a person is threatened he fights and attempts to put down the source of the threat. For example, the entrance of a new child into the school has become a battleground for the two programs. The competition is fierce and children and parents are solicited by each program. Movement from one program to another is very difficult because of the competition. If children are transferred from one program to another it reduces the number of students a teacher has and often threatens the position because there are no longer enough students. Children and parents are seen as vehicles to support a program. Thus, I would suggest that the two track system is not providing the individualization it was created to do and at the same time it is creating strife. I have sensed a great deal of mistrust and suspicious among the staff of the school supervisors and administration.</p>
			<p>The strife and competition generated among staff is spread to the parents. The parents soon “join one camp or the other,” become strong advocates of a method and then try to “win converts to their cause.” We have found parents of children in the PIP that are already so biased they cannot accept communicative and educational recommendations from the PIP staff.</p>
			<p>I believe the two track system must consider of educational (communicative) alternatives not separate programming. There must be structure which allows for a fluid system permitting the movement of children and staff to maximize the education for each child. I believe the school must hire educators of the deaf not oralists or manualists. These teachers should be able to teach all deaf children in their particular area of expertise, not total communication or oral. I believe the teachers and supervisors must be concerned with children not with methods. The method should be used only as educational (communicative) alternatives.</p>
			<p>I realize this would be very difficult to achieve but I believe it must be done or TWO separate schools established. If the state establishes two separate schools for the deaf they will eliminate the inhouse strife but the external strife will be escalated and the competition for children will become even greater. I believe the state should do everything possible to develop a functional two option communicative program. I believe the two school notion would create more problems than it would solve.</p>
			<p>I would suggest that the place to begin is to change the current pre-school, infant program and 1st and 2nd grade program into an “Early Childhood Program” with one person over the whole program. The teachers would work with either “Total” or “Oral” children or both. Those teachers who could not do this could be moved to another level. Children in the Early Childhood Program would not be placed in an “oral” or “total” program but would receive whatever training is recommended and appropriate. By the time a child leaves the Early Childhood Program a complete communicative evaluation and trail program could have been completed and he could then be placed in a “total track” or “oral track.” As this system develops and becomes functional, it could be slowly moved to the other areas of the school.</p>
			<p>I realize I am suggesting you open a huge “can of worms.” This would take a great deal of planning and commitment to implement” (p. 82-83).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Dr. Campbell agreed with the letter and recommended the 	"two track system" be continued in completely separate programs in order to solve the internal/external issues, reduce the competition, as well as relieve the tension between these programs. He also supported with the idea of each program to have its own dean, supervisor, principal, teachers and students emphasis.</p>
		<p>During the study, the Utah State Office of Education appointed Dr. Robert G. Sanderson to conduct a survey of the alumni of the USD to confirm their feelings about the education they received at the school. The survey compared graduates from the USD prior to 1948, those who had graduated 1948 to 1959, and those who graduated 1960 to 1977. The results showed a marked difference in feelings. Those that graduated prior to 1948 seemed to like school, understood the teachers, and liked the administrators much better than those who graduated from 1960 to 1977. The results of the students graduating between 1948 to 1959 fell between the two other categories (Sanderson, 1977).</p>
		<p>From the results of the study, Dr. Campbell developed some recommendations, including the following:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Restructure and strengthen the programs to reduce the competition as well as tension and meet the children’s educational needs through fair placement process,</li>
			<li>Improve the evaluation on each student for proper placement based on communication methods used in educating the deaf,</li>
			<li>Provide periodic evaluations of all students and recommendations for transfer,</li>
			<li>Provide aid and education to parents in their decision regarding placement,</li>
			<li>Improve curriculum and offer vocational courses to insure training to develop necessary skills to obtain employment,</li>
			<li>Encourage teachers and parents to become involved with the Deaf community and have the right attitude toward the deaf,</li>
			<li>Include the state evaluative process for deaf children in school districts under the direction of USD and make recommendation on placements, whether it was oral, total communication or districts,</li>
			<li>Keep up with the research on services and education progresses,</li>
			<li>Coordinate the educational research of USD with research from other states, and</li>
			<li>Reconsider and rewrite USD policies to clarify their intent and ensure that they reflect a coherent and consistent policy (Campbell, 1977).</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Education of Deaf Stirs Debate; No Action Taken</h3>
		<p>However, on the same day, more than 300 parents of deaf children filled the gymnasium at the Ogden main campus to hear Dr. Grant B. Bitter’s presentation at the Utah State Board of Education meeting. In the three months, the speakers at the Utah State Board of Education meeting argued over the best method and separation of the two programs as well as the physical facilities (Peters, Deseret News, April 15, 1977). The central theme presented to the State Board focused on energy spent arguing whether the oral or total approach was the best method for teaching the deaf should be re-channeled into improving both programs (Cummins, Salt Lake Tribune, April 15, 1977).</p>
		<p>Dr. Bitter scolded both oralists and totalists for continual arguments over which method is the best. He urged that they stop urging and unify to improve the quality of education given to deaf children (Peters, Deseret News, April 15, 1977). He also stressed the importance of providing parents options for their children, as well as preserving the rights of parents in making decisions concerning the education for their children (Cummins, Salt Lake Tribune, April 15, 1977). Dr. Bitter gave his presentation against Dr. Campbell’s study, stating his report contained inaccuracies and inferences both about the Teacher Education Program, Area of the Deaf at the University of Utah and educational programs within the State of Utah (G.B. Bitter, personal communication, March 6, 1978). Dr. Bitter presented to the board saying that he respected the input of Dr. Barnett and Dr. David Nelson as their reports would be of value as portions of the study. However, he felt much of the data did not reflect current needs, issues, trends and solutions, to the problems and concerns of Utah. He questioned the validity and reliability of the population and sampling procedures used by Dr. Sanderson. Dr. Bitter challenged that some of the judgments made by Dr. Campbell and others who provided information lacked appropriate input from the field and adequate documentation. Furthermore, he urged that unfair assumptions were also made regarding deaf students enrolled full time in several school districts. Thus, he requested for a delay in the acceptance of the report for implementing action (G.B. Bitter, personal communication, April 14, 1977).</p>
		<p>Most criticism was aimed at a February report to the State Board by Dr. Sanderson and the subsequent study by Dr. Campbell. Some spokesmen said Dr. Sanderson advocated operating separate schools for the two educational programs, but retaining the Ogden school for the total communication approach. Others said the two previous reported implied that the orientation program for parents of students entering the Ogden campus is biased in favor of the oral approach (Cummins, Salt Lake Tribune, April 15, 1977).</p>
		<p>Peter Viahos, an Ogden attorney and father of a deaf daughter, told the group that Utah “is fortunate to have both methods of instruction, but it is unfortunate that we have almost continual conflict.” I’m very proud of every achievement my daughter makes.” Why try to prove one method is better than the other when we should be concerned with educating our children” (Peters, Deseret News, April 15, 1977). During the emotional delivery, he said Dr. Campbell may have little interest in what parents have to say here today.” Peter also said that two-thirds of the deaf school students’ parents whom he represented “requested that Dr. Campbell and Dr. Sanderson not be allowed to continue in influential positions over oral students.” Dr. Bitter expressed their concerns about Dr. Campbell’s studies excluded interviews with parents of the USD’s students (Ogden Standard-Examiner, April 15, 1977).</p>
		<p>While Dr. Bitter and Peter Viahos gave a presentation, they received cheers and standing ovations from over 300 parents who advocated oralism (Ogden Standard-Examiner, April 15, 1977). Under the influence of Dr. Bitter, the parents urged the State Board to suspend Dr. Campbell’s comprehensive study and they were so distressed with his study that they demanded that he be fired. Instead, the Utah State Board of Education reached the decision to replace Dr. Campbell with Dr. Lerue Winget. Dr. Walter D. Talbot, State Superintendent of Public Instruction assigned Dr. Campbell to a different position at the Utah State Office of Education (Dr. Jay J. Campbell, personal communication, July 1, 2007).</p>
		<p>Despite the study conducted by neutral researchers, no action on the presentations was taken by the State Board, but they accepted the reports as they provided a great deal of supplementary literature (Ogden Standard-Examiner, April 15, 1977).</p>
		<p>Dr. Campbell’s two years of comprehensive study with recommendations of improving USD’s education through fair evaluation and placement procedures was shared with the Utah State Board of Education. However, it was buried and forgotten. The trend at USD of establishing inappropriate placement procedures partly due to unshared information continued (Dr. Jay J. Campbell, personal communication, July 1, 2007). [PHOTO]</p>

			<p>A few years after Dr. Jay J. Campbell presented to the Utah State Board of Education on April 14, 1977, Norman Williams (USD ’62) was working at the Utah State Office of Education. While he was cleaning the offices, he unexpectedly found Dr. Campbell’s Comprehensive Study in a trash can. Norman had heard so much about his study and was thrilled to have his book in hand (Norman Williams, personal communication, January 20, 1010).</p>

			<p>While ongoing controversy over oral and total communication methodologies, Utah State Board of Education Chairman Jay A. Monson guessed that the University of Utah’s oral proponents have created many the personnel problems at the Utah School for the Deaf during the past several years (Cole, 1977).</p>

		<h3>Dr. Grant B. Bitter’s Recommendations for Improving Educational Programs for the Deaf and Establishing a Statewide Comprehensive Plan </h3>
		<p>Despite Dr. Jay J. Campbell’s effort with his Education of the Deaf in Utah, Comprehensive Study, Dr. Grant B. Bitter wasted no time making a list of recommendations on behalf of the Utah Council of Parents of Hearing Impaired Children. The recommendations were included for improving educational programs for the deaf and establishing a statewide comprehensive plan. Dr. Bitter presented the recommendations to the Utah State Board of Education on April 14, 1977, the same day Dr. Campbell was due to give his presentation regarding his study.</p>
		<p>Before Dr. Bitter shared the recommendations, he applauded a following degree of functionally being achieved that other states desired:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The development of and preservation of parents’ rights, opportunities, and responsibilities for the education of their deaf children,</li>
			<li>The right to educational alternatives or options, i.e. an oral track or total communication track in separate and adequate facilities,</li>
			<li>The opportunities available for the placement of deaf children into regular public school classes, Extension Day Classes, or the Residential School in Ogden. The Utah School for the Deaf makes available day class placements in the public schools – a unique option in Utah. The school districts in the State of Utah are to be commended for their willingness to cooperate with parents and the Utah School for the deaf for either day class placement or full time placement in district schools. Greater efforts in this area must be given to the development and preparation of adequate support personnel to meet merging needs under Public Law 94-142, including appropriate diagnostic procedures and tracking systems. In this process, parent involvement is essential. The creation of the State Advisory Council for Hearing Conservation as recommended will give strength in all areas of concern to improve educational excellence.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Dr. Bitter proposed the recommendations and resolutions that will assist in implementing the Public Law 94-142 which deals with the rights of individuals with disabilities in the educational system as follows:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The right to due process,</li>
			<li>Protection against discriminatory testing in diagnosis,</li>
			<li>Placement in an educational setting that is the least restrictive environment, and</li>
			<li> Individualized program plans.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Through the alliance of parents, Dr. Bitter also proposed that the educational, social, and vocational needed by the deaf population be altered within the State of Utah as follows:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>A review of the usefulness of the presently constituted Governor’s Advisory Council to the Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind.</li>
			<li>The employment of at least one well qualified professional rehabilitation counselor to represent auditory/oral individuals who seek assistance from the Division of Rehabilitation Services for the Deaf.</li>
			<li>The feasibility of developing a long-range cost benefit study analyzing the costs per pupil per year of education in the Utah School for the Deaf (Ogden), Extension Day Classes (Salt Lake City), multiple-handicapped facilities, and school districts that provide full time enrollment of deaf children in regular school classes.</li>
			<li>The organization of a state-wide Comprehensive Advisory Council for Hearing Conversation.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Dr. Bitter proposed that appropriate representation be assigned to groups, agencies, organizations, and institutions. Lastly, he said that “None of us can allow ourselves to dissipate tax dollars, human energy and resources on the historic, destructive, and extremely divisive conflict over philosophy and methodology among diverse groups of the hearing impaired, and for the hearing impaired; the question is not of either or; or which is best for all hearing impaired children, but rather “How can we improve the quality of existing programs for the hearing impaired to make them more efficient and effective?” We must safeguard equal educational rights and opportunities and educational alternatives in the least restrictive environment” (Bitter, 1977).</p>
		<h3>George D. Wilding Speaks Up</h3>
		<p>On July 4, 1977, George D. Wilding, a deaf individual wrote a letter sharing his experience in Dr. Grant B. Bitter’s classroom with Dr. Orlando Rivera, Vice President for Academic Affairs at the University of Utah.</p>
		<p>George reported that he walked into Dr. Bitter’s Special Education 502, Introduction to Special Education class, with his interpreter, Wilma Powell on the first day of class at the University of Utah during the Summer Quarter of 1975. He had to take this course to meet his job’s requirement. George stated that Dr. Bitter was not happy to see him and told him to “go to the back of the classroom.” He felt the professor did not want others in the class to see his interpreter. George also felt prejudiced and discriminated. He compared himself to “Jim Crow.” This situation made George and his interpreter feel like black people being ordered to the back of the bus in the South. George reported that was denying his equal opportunity to sit where he wanted; he was denying the other students in the class an opportunity to see what an interpreter was like and how she worked to convey the information to him. After the first day, George became angry and sat up front where he wanted and refused to go to the back of the room again.</p>
		<p>George expressed it was a shame that the University of Utah can put up with that kind of bigotry and bias from a so-called professor. A professor who did not like deaf people who did not agree with him or accept them should not be teaching in the field. He also shared his view that if the professor didn’t like and accept interpreters then he sure didn’t know very much about deafness and the overwhelming majoring of deaf people who needed and used interpreters.</p>
		<p>Further, George shared his perspective that the curriculum for training teachers of the deaf demonstrated Dr. Bitter’s total bias. The professor had to be forced to set up a three-hour class in sign language for students, but in what other language (French, German, Russian, or whatever) can competence be established in one quarter at three hours a week??? Yet speech got fifteen or more hours of credit, and what were the total results? The great majority of deaf students who learned to “speak” from these “trained teachers of the deaf” quickly learned that virtually nobody except their teachers and parents understood them so they quickly switched to sign language as soon as they were free from the oral prison. In other words, Dr. Bitter was a teacher trying to teach things that deaf people were not going to use, and was ignoring the basic skills that deaf youths were really going to use. In fact, sign language was the third largest language in the United States.</p>
		<p>George observed that Dr. Bitter’s priorities were all screwed up. George believed that sign language should be taught as the primary language of deaf people. English should be taught as a second language; and speech should be taught as a third language. This was the way it really was in the world of deafness, he said.</p>
		<p>George pointed out that it was not the way Bitter wanted it to be, nor how parents wanted it to be. That was the way it really was; that was the way deaf people live and work and play in the real world. He observed that since Dr. Bitter didn’t understand that, his competence could be challenged.</p>
		<p>In other words, if Dr. Bitter can take away the Spanish language from the Spanish community, they would resent this and rebel against him. That was how the Deaf community felt. Try to take away their sign language – they would feel the same as other minorities (George Wilding, personal communication, June 4, 1977).</p>
		<p>However, Dr. Bitter responded on July 11, 1977 and denied forcing George to sit in the back of the room. He stated George was among 60 students in his class and there were no seats available except near the back of the room. His interpreter came in late and there was a seat beside George. Dr. Bitter explained to his boss, Dr. Donald R. Logan, chairman of the Department of Special Education in his letter that he quickly ascertained the circumstance and after class consulted with George and his interpreter regarding respective needs. They mutually agreed that George would sit in an appropriate location that would be suitable for him and his manual interpreter. It was not a forced issue. Dr. Bitter stated that the implication made in George’s letter that he was coerced to go to the back of the room was without foundation, as was the charge that he was denied setting where he wished (G. B. Bitter, personal communication, July 11, 1977).</p>
		<p>Dr. Bitter denied George’s accusations. He reported that George was a respected member of the class with every opportunity to speak out on issues, problems, trends, concerns, knowledge and experiences. He also stated that his class members were appreciative of his participation and involvement as was he. Every effort was made to help him and his interpreter feel welcome and comfortable in the learning environment throughout the quarter (G. B. Bitter, personal communication, July 11, 1977).</p>
		<h3>Dr. Grant B. Bitter’s Additional Recommendations for the Improvement of Statewide Services for the Deaf</h3>
		<p>As soon as Dr. Jay J. Campbell was out of the picture in April 1977, Dr. Grant B. Bitter revised and made three additional recommendations to further seek improvement in the statewide services of the Deaf. He presented his recommendations to the Utah State Board of Education in Bingham City on August 19, 1977.</p>
		<p>Before Dr. Bitter made recommendations, he shared his concerns with suggestions for providing adequate delivery of services patterns for deaf children/youth/adults and their families in a continuing search to develop and maintain optional and quality educational programs.</p>
		<p>Dr. Bitter asked that the needs be met as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>He recognized that there was undue fragmentation, lack of communication, cooperation, and proliferation of services and programs in Utah to meet the needs of the deaf. He stated that various agencies and organizations in Utah did not frequently have all the data necessary to make adequate and appropriate referral nor to provide accurate, unbiased information and facts regarding the types and nature of services available for the deaf.</li>
			<li>He reported the rapidly increasing number of deaf and hard of hearing children moving into public school classes. He recommended the need for administrators at the residential school for the deaf and its extension program and the administrators in the 40 school districts to establish and maintain a cooperative and efficient plan for referral of and tracking of students, evaluating progress and developing support systems as needed to assist those children achieve success in their respective educational placements.</li>
			<li>Furthermore, Dr. Bitter said that because of implementation of Public Law 94-142 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, it was necessary to form teamwork, correlation and cooperation with the Utah State Board of Education and the various professional agencies, clinics, hospitals, institutions, schools parent organizations and universities. He recommended that the evolution regarding the future role of the Utah School for the Deaf and the school districts in the State of Utah provide appropriate placement of deaf children and youth. Additionally, he emphasized the importance of urgent consideration in terms of orderly transition and shifts in school populations and the appropriate utilization of professional staff members to meet the future needs of deaf children in both urban and rural areas of the state as well as at the Utah School for the Deaf in Ogden and its extension programs.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Dr. Bitter viewed the Governor’s Advisory Council to the Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind as limited and restricted. He observed that this Council had become a battleground for argument and futile debate over oral versus manual communication issues, which had little positive effect, if any at all, on the conduct and efficiency of programs serving children. He stated that the Council’s work had been described as “exercise in futility.”</p>
		<p>Because of the Governor’s Advisory Council’s limited role, Dr. Bitter asked that a broader-based committee is needed to deal with emerging trends, issues, and needs. Moreover, the committee provides assistance to the Advisory Council in the more efficient and effective accomplishment of its mission. Thus, he recommended the Board’s approval for the State Superintendent of Public Instruction to form a statewide Advisory Commission for Hearing Conservation. Additionally, he asked that the mission of the Advisory Commission to:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Prepare a comprehensive plan to assure the education all deaf children and youth in Utah – utilizing the experience and expertise of a broadly-base commission as a vehicle for study, review, analysis and evaluation of programs for the deaf and minimizing the possibilities of biasness, contention, inaccuracies, and inadequacies of data.</li>
			<li>Consider as a part of the plan, the relationship of education, rehabilitation, and the related problems of aging. Recommend ways and means by which the needs of the deaf population can be more adequately met through the orderly continuum of services – birth to death. The Parent Infant Program must continue as a basic part of the continuum of services.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Dr. Bitter reported that parents and oral deaf young people who frequently seek help from the Utah State Office of Vocational Rehabilitation – Division of Services for the Deaf, were bewildered and disappointed with bias, intimidation, and lack of professional attitudes which some professional staff members had demonstrated. He recommended that the Board instruct the Office of Adult, Vocational and Rehabilitation Services to initiate action for the employment of a skilled professional representing the auditory/oral approach to work as a counselor with oral deaf individuals who were entitled to services from that office.</p>
		<p>Lastly, because of Dr. Bitter’s opposition to Dr. Campbell’s 1977 Education of the Deaf in Utah, Comprehensive Study, he recommended to the Board that systematic procedures be established for the study of, orientation to, and evaluation of philosophies and methodologies concerning the habilitation, education, and rehabilitation of the deaf population (Bitter, 1977).</p>
		<p>The result of the Board’s decision to approve Dr. Bitter’s recommendation for forming an Advisory Committee is unknown.</p>
		<h3>A Protest at the University of Utah	</h3>
		<p>Since 1962, the controversy between oral and total communication was heated because of the oral training being implemented in the teacher preparation program within the Special Education Department at the University of Utah. The University of Utah, home of a nationally and internationally recognized oral/aural deaf education program, was the battleground between the “oralists” and the “manualists” in Utah (Utah’s Hearing Impaired Children...At High Risk, 1986).</p>
		<p>Under the direction of Dr. Grant B. Bitter, his program impacted the oral philosophy movement at the Utah School for the Deaf and the mainstreaming growth in the education of the deaf. The history of protest at the University of Utah gives us a background of how Utah Association for the Deaf (UAD renamed from “of” to “for” in 1963) and the Deaf community’s concerns were not fully met.</p>
		<p>On August 12, 1977, Ms. Myrna Burbank, former President of the Parent Teacher Association of the Oral Department at the Utah School for the Deaf, received an unsigned letter against oralism and supporting total communication (M. Burbank, personal communication, August 12, 1977). The anonymous author of this letter stated that Ms. Burbank was “trying to hurt Jay J. Campbell and Dr. Robert G. Sanderson because they are for total communication.” The letter went on to threaten that Ms. Burbank's daughter will be convinced that total communication “is the best way...” The letter concludes with the implication that Ms. Burbank is paternalistic. The origin of this letter and how it tied in to the debate at the University of Utah deserved further exploration. Additionally, an 8.5 by 11 inch threat that “Jay J. Campbell will put Burbank down. Power is UAD” was disseminated. (Appendix B &#38; C)</p>
		<p>Along a similar vein, Boyd Nielsen, a graduate of Dr. Bitter’s teacher training program of 1966 and a staff member and also of the oral department of the Utah School for the Deaf, received threatening letters, one explicitly from UAD and one anonymous. The first, dated August 15, 1977, implied that “J.J. Campbell and Dr. Robert Sanderson will throw Boyd Nielsen out of job in Utah, in America, and out of this world. UAD is Deaf power.” The other letter, actually a drawing of Mr. Nielsen with a noose around his neck, appears to be from 1970 but without any explicit reference to the oralism versus total communication controversy. The mystery of this latter item is intriguing and deserves further investigation.</p>
		<p>In either late August or early September, 1977, representatives from the UAD met with Dr. Pete D. Gardner, Vice President for Academic Affairs at the University, to present a 10-point list of concerns regarding the Teacher Training Program. During this meeting, Mrs. Lloyd Perkins functioned as the sign language interpreter for Mr. Lloyd Perkins and other UAD members.</p>
		<p>The UAD wanted to meet with President Emery to present their concerns. However, in response to this meeting, Dr. Gardner sent a letter addressed to Mrs. Lloyd Perkins (see Appendix G), explaining that a meeting with President Emery would be unproductive and that Dr. Dr. Bitter had not violated any academic standards (P.D. Gardner, personal communication, September 14, 1977).</p>
		<p>Mr. Lloyd Perkins responded to this letter with disappointment. He clarified the role of Mrs. Perkins as the interpreter only, and that, by responding to Mrs. Perkins by letter, he was handling the situation in a patronizing way. He stated “We want to be dealt with directly, not as second class citizens” (L.H. Perkins, personal communication, September 27, 1977). This letter shows that Dr. Gardner did not, in fact, fully investigate the issue nor understand that Mrs. Perkins was not a key player in this controversy.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, Dr. Bitter prepared a lengthy response refuting the “slanderous” charges made by Mr. Perkins. He lists the individual charges and provides an additional material supporting each of his responses (G.B. Bitter, personal communication, October 10, 1977).</p>
		<p>The University delegated the responsibility of handling this situation to Cedric I. Davern, Vice-President for Academic Affairs. Dr. Davern sent a letter to Mr. Perkins detailing that the Utah State Board of Education was conducting hearings on the oralism versus TC controversy and that a report would be available soon (see Appendix J). He refused to make any changes until that report became available (C.I. Davern, personal communication, October 28, 1977).</p>
		<p>Mr. Perkins response was that, up to this point, there have been no specific issues or concerns laid out, only general concerns. The UAD hoped to be more specific in a meeting with President Emery (see Appendix K). The response also reflects that Dr. Davern was not fully informed of the issues regarding the discussion before the State Board of Education nor was he knowledgeable of the program at Utah State University, which does not have a Teacher Preparation Program for the Deaf. Mr. Perkins concludes the letter by reiterating that the UAD would like a meeting with the administrators of the University (L.H. Perkins, personal communication, November 7, 1977).</p>
		<p>The controversy became public in November, 1977, when members of the UAD, led by Dave Mortensen, UAD President protested outside the Utah State Board of Education office (Chaffin, November 19, 1977, p. 30 A) and in front of the Park Building on the University campus (UAD letter, 1977; UAD Flier, 1977).</p>
		<p>Attached is the UAD Flier below. (APPENDIX)</p>
		<p>Dr. Bitter denied being biased against the Deaf community. Even through the training program emphasized oralism, he responded to the protest by saying “we are endeavoring to be fair and meet individual needs” (Hunt, November 29, 1977, p. 1; Hunt, December 2, 1977). He favored the oral-only because in his view, it was the best way to help the deaf become independent, functional members of the society, with a healthy self-concept (Hunt, November 29, 1977, p. 1). Additionally, he believed that oralism best prepared a deaf person for a normal life as part of society, and the independence aspect should be underscored in any program. He also stated that basic skills in sign language are also taught at the training program, along with an opportunity for contact with the deaf community through practicum. Dr. Bitter reminded the protesters that the University of Utah had fulfilled its obligation to the Utah State Board of Education by providing experiences in total communication in the oral curriculum (The University of Utah, November 28, 1977; Hunt, December 2, 1977).</p>
		<p>The <em>Deseret News</em> printed a letter to the editor from M.J. Lewis, purporting that “Dr. Bitter has so brainwashed and put fear into parents, that their children will never be able to function as normal human beings” (Lewis, November 28, 1977). The Daily Utah Chronicle had articles on the protest (Hunt, November 19 and Hunt, December 16, 1977), as well as a letter to the editor in response to those articles. In this letter, S.C. Sundstrom states to Lisa M. Hunt, the author of the Chronicle articles, that there is “...no evidence here that you have investigated the viewpoints or rationale of these [Deaf] individuals” (S.C. Sundstrom, December 6, 1977).</p>
		<p>After the protest, the Utah State Board of Education gathered met and made the following decisions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Two distinct programs of instruction shall be conducted at the Utah School for the Deaf, in Ogden, Oral and Total Communication.</li>
			<li>A procedure shall be established for diagnosis, evaluation and placement of students according to their needs, and such placement shall require the approval of parents and guardians.</li>
			<li>A long-range research shall be instituted to determine the characteristics of students for whom certain programs work best.</li>
			<li>Students in oral and total programs at the school shall be separated through junior high school.			</li>
			<li>The Utah School for the Deaf shall report to the board’s office in Instructional Services. This means that if the policy is adopted, USD Superintendent Robert Tegeder would report to Associate Superintendent Lerue Winget, rather than to Associate Superintendent Jay J. Campbell.			</li>
			<li>School faculty members (and also members of the state board staff) were constrained from taking sides in disputes regarding methodology.			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Apparently, because of oral advocate parents’ complaint, Dr. Campbell was out of the picture and could no longer supervise USD. Appointment of an advisory committee was deferred. The USOE Board called for studies to determine whether or not a total communication program of teacher preparation was needed.</p>
		<h3>The Battle Wanes</h3>
		<p>In early 1978,	the UAD brought their concerns to the University of Utah Institutional Council. Dr. Grant B. Bitter, again, denied the charges against him. He stated that some members of the Deaf community charged:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>that I disparage the ‘...deaf community... its members... its organizations...including the deaf religious community...’ This assertion is unwarranted. The deaf community as a whole is composed of people who want to live their lives in their own way. They are very talented, industrious, and honest. They are much like other citizens in our communities, but many of them have been led to believe by some of their advocates that I am their enemy; that I am endangering their society; that I am abolishing sign language and collapsing their communication system. This kind of hearsay reporting is, indeed, unethical. (G.B. Bitter, personal communication, March 6, 1978).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>In April 1979, the Utah State Board of Education passed a motion directing the University of Utah to add a faculty member to teach total communication skills to perspective teachers of the deaf. The State Board will review the matter in a year and if the instructor is not added will consider withdrawing accreditation of the University of Utah teacher-training program for the deaf (Jeff Pollock, personal communication, May 4, 2005).</p>
		<h3>A Separation Policy at Utah School for the Deaf</h3>
		<p>Since 1962, the Utah Association of the Deaf frowned over Utah School for the Deaf for separating one group of deaf students from another on the same campus on the basis of the educational philosophy.</p>
		<p>On November 18, 1977, this separation issue (along with others) was brought up by Dr. Walter D. Talbot, State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Utah Association for the Deaf distributed “The Silent Spotlight” asking the Deaf community for support to assure the quality of education and high caliber of Deaf Unit in the Division of Rehabilitation presented by him.</p>
		<p>On November 21, an Utah Association for the Deaf delegates, David Mortensen, UAD President; Paul Chamberlain, UAD Vice-President; Dora Laramie, Kenneth Burdett and Beth Ann Campbell, interpreter, took their opportunity to meet with Dr. Walter D. Talbot to clarify and make changes on three issues that were brought up on the 18th of November. The issues were:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Separation Policy at Utah School for the Deaf,</li>
			<li>the break-up of the deaf unit of the Rehabilitation Services Administration, and</li>
			<li>the 22-member hearing conservation committee.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Besides two other issues, Dr. Talbot and the UAD delegation agreed to work on the problem of methodology separation of deaf students as presented in the new USD policy (The Silent Spotlight, November 1977). While developing this policy, Dr. Talbot had been consulting with the UAD delegation and the oral group, including Dr. Grant B. Bitter. He had a meeting with Dr. Bitter and his group on December 5th.</p>
		<p>In Dr. Talbot’s letter to Dr. Bitter on December 6, 1977, he explained that although UAD had agreed to the proposed policy with the minor changes accepted by Dr. Bitter and his group, UAD insisted on seeking a legal opinion from the Attorney General to see if mandatory separation socially and for instructional methodology complies with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and other laws dealing with nondiscrimination. Dr. Talbot had sent his request to the Attorney General and UAD was interested in seeking an opinion from a lawyer of it own choosing (Dr. Talbot, personal communication, December 6, 1977).</p>
		<p>In that letter, Dr. Talbot expressed his a bit disappointment that the group did not accept his alternative number 9 which would base the degree of separation of instruction, living accommodations, and social life on an individual education plan. He felt they would be in a much better situation to separate students under an individual education plan basis which had been approved by the student, parent (s), and school officials acting jointly than we would be under a policy which will not permit the school administration to permit instructional and social integration even if a parent requests it (Dr. Talbot, personal communication, December 6, 1977).</p>
		<p>On December 16, 1977, after months of listening to the debate from advocates of “oral” and “total” methodologies of instruction and consulting with two groups, Dr. Walter D. Talbot drew a “Policy on Education of the Hearing Impaired,” which the Utah State Board of Education accepted, including the controversial item 9 which had been presented at the November meeting, which did not wholly please to either group. The item dealt with separation of oral and total communication students (G.B. Bitter, personal communication, March 6, 1978). The policy emphasized that:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>“Two distinct programs of instruction (oral and total) shall be available to all students at the State School for the Deaf, Ogden. Students will be assigned according to individual need as determined by the student, parents, and school officials" (Chaffin, 1977).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The Policy on Education of the Hearing Impaired emphasized that:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Two distinct programs of instruction (oral and total) shall be available to all students at the State School for the Deaf, Ogden. Students will be assigned according to individual need as determined by the student, parents, and school officials.</li>
			<li>The school will report to Dr. Lerue Winget of the board’s office of instructional services. Formerly it reported to Dr. Jay J. Campbell of the office of administration services. Students in the two programs shall be kept separate through junior high school years.</li>
			<li>Students in the high school years shall not be separated socially. Students whose academic programs are taken at another school (such as a high school) for one-half day or more shall be expected to engage in extracurricular activities at that school, rather than this School for the Deaf (Chaffin, 1977).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The two programs were kept separated so that the total communication students would not infect the oral students with their signing. The Utah attorney general had said there was no conflict with the act of separation. UAD believed it may be illegal and was consulting legal advisors on this matter (The Silent Spotlight, January 1978).</p>
		<p>Per a request from UAD, on April 11, 1978, Dr. Jay J. Campbell wrote a letter to David S. Tatel, Director of the Office for Civil Rights in Washington, D.C. asking, “Does Sec. 504 allow a school system “to segregate or separate” one group of deaf students from another “on the same campus on the basis of the educational philosophy of the school and/or parents?” (Dr. Campbell, personal communication, April 11, 1978).</p>
		<p>David S. Tatel responded on July 10, 1978 saying that “If it is determined that information sound pedagogical reasons, “it is inappropriate to educate a particular deaf child in the regular educational environment, and an alternative placement provides a free appropriate public education,” that it will not be considered a violation of Sec. 504 to separate their children to the determines” (David S. Tatel, personal communication, July 10, 1978).</p>
		<p>The real question Dr. Campbell would like Tatel to respond to, “Is it legal under Section 504 or under the comparable sections of the Civil Rights Act to segregate to separate deaf children on the same campus on the basis of the educational philosophy of the school and/or the parents say more so than it is to segregate black and white children on the basis of race or color? (Dr. Campbell, personal communication, April 11, 1978). Tatel answered Dr. Campbell’s question concerning the segregation on the same school campus on the basis of the educational philosophy.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Thank you for your letter of April 11, 1978, clarifying your inquiry of December 15, 1977, concerning the Department’s Regulation implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Your question is whether it is legal under Section 504 to segregate or separate certain deaf children from other deaf children on the same campus on the basis of the educational philosophy of the school and/or parents.</p>
			<p>Attached to your letter of April 11, 1978, was a paper entitled, “The Deaf Child-Controversy Over Teaching Methods” describing a controversy among educators respecting the best method for teaching the prelingually severely or profoundly deaf child.</p>
			<p>On the one hand, the advocates of the oralist school of thought contend that most deaf children can be taught to speak and lipread. They also contend that (a) sign language segregates the deaf into their own subculture, (b) gesture should be kept to a minimum, and (c) sign language should be forbidden because it will destroy the chance of oral success.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, the advocates of the total communications school of thought contend that most of the deaf cannot become oral successes. They believe that sign language does not inhibit speech development. All methods are to be used, including sign language, speech, and lipreading. Only time will tell which combination best suits a particular deaf child.</p>
			<p>Subpart D. of the Regulation generally prescribes the requirements recipients operating preschool, elementary, and secondary education programs must satisfy.</p>
			<p>As you may know, Section 84.33 of the Regulation generally provides that recipients must provide a free appropriate public education to each qualified handicapped person within its jurisdiction. Section 84.34 (a) provides that a qualified handicapped person must be educated with persons who are not handicapped” to the maximum extend appropriate to the needs of the handicapped person.” Once a determination has been made that it is inappropriate to educate a particular deaf child in the regular educational environment and an alternative placement provides a free appropriate public education, this office will not require that the recipient choose between two competing educational philosophies. To the extend it is necessary, for sound pedagogical reasons to separate children enrolled in the oralist program from the children enrolled in the total communications program. No violation of Section 504 will be deemed to have occurred.</p>

		<p>After receiving the letters from Tatel, there was not much UAD could do about this situation.</p>
		<h3>Dave Mortensen Criticizes Dr. Grant B. Bitter	</h3>
		<p>On February 2, 1978, Dave Mortensen, president of the Utah Association for the Deaf submitted his letter to Dr. Edward W. Clyde, chairman of the University of Utah Institutional Council criticizing Dr. Grant B. Bitter’s unprofessional conduct during his presentation to the Utah State Board of Education on August 19, 1977.</p>
		<p>Among the political-ethical conflict over the issues, President Mortensen asked that Dr. Bitter “be reprimanded and put on probation or other correct measures to stop the unprofessional conduct of a man that should not be at the University of Utah in the first place” (Dave Mortensen, personal communication, February 2, 1978). One month later on March 6, 1978, Dr. Bitter responded to Dr. Clyde by denying his wrongdoings; he answered with supporting documentation proving the attacks (G.B. Bitter, personal communication, March 6, 1978). As powerful, adept talker, and skilled presenter as Dr. Bitter was, no intervention was made (Dave Mortensen, personal communication, February 2, 1978).</p>
		<h3>Constant Controversy over the Teacher Preparation Program at the University of Utah</h3>
		<p>Because of constant controversy over the Teacher Preparation Program at the University of Utah, Dr. Walter D. Talbot, State Superintendent wrote a letter to Don Logan, Chairman of the Department of Special Education at the University of Utah on August 27, 1979. In his letter, he recognized the concerns expressed by members of the Utah State Board of Education in discussing the matter related to the feeling that the total communication area was being neglected in the training program. He stated that even through all students in the program had opportunity for experiences in Total Communication, the emphasis was largely on oral. He even stated the board felt there needs to be a program in total communication equal to that oral of the program.</p>
		<p>Dr. Talbot tried to help find a solution for bringing total communication into equal status with oral by recommending:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>A change in the role assignment by the Regents to permit a Total Communication program be provided at another Utah teacher training institution,</li>
			<li>Disapprove the University of Utah’s program by refusing to certify individuals graduating from that program</li>
			<li>There be no program in Utah higher education institutions for training educators of the deaf (Dr. Talbot, personal communication, August 27, 1979).</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The first recommendation was not met until 1982 (Utah’s Hearing Impaired Children...At High Risk, 1986).</p>
		<h3>The Repeated Request of the Deaf Community Was Ignored</h3>
		<p>Since 1968, Ned C. Wheeler, a deaf person had served on the Governor’s Advisory Council for the Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind. After his death in 1981, a hearing person was appointed, despite a request by the Utah Association for the Deaf that a deaf person be appointed. Deaf community urged they were not represented on the five-member council. Despite the repeated requests that a deaf person be appointed to the council, they had been ignored.</p>
		<p>On May 23, 1984, Dave Mortensen, president of the Utah Association for the Deaf objected to the present then present make up of the those sitting on the Institutional Council because it had no deaf representative. He said, “There was a deaf member on the Governor’s Council, but after Ned C. Wheeler died, a hearing person was named in his place. Wouldn’t you think that a deaf person should have been named to fill the vacancy of a deaf member who had died?” (Dabling, Salt Lake Tribune, May 24, 1984).</p>
		<p>Dave requested a meeting in February 1984 with State Schools Superintendent G. Leland Burningham so the UAD could assure that the Deaf community would be represented. However, he learned that the Governor’s Advisory Council would serve as the Institutional Council, and did not get a letter from Dr. Burningham until April of that year (Dabling, Salt Lake Tribune, May 24, 1984). After that, nothing happened.</p>
		<p>Two years later in March 1986, the UAD wrote a letter to Governor Norm Bangerter and Bernarr Furse, state superintendent of public instruction requesting that a deaf person be appointed and still nothing happened. Five months later on August 3, 1986, Dave Mortensen, UAD president spoke up by saying, “We have been to the State Board of Education, we have met with Bernarr. We [Deaf community] were concerned that a deaf person was not on the Advisory Council.” Dave also said, “We told Bernarr our concerns and [he] understood the problem but it was as far as he went. There was a vacancy coming up. It seems to me like we had some deaf people who applied.”</p>
		<p>Furse, however, had no recollection of hearing such a request. He said, “I’m not aware of such request. Whether there are any board members that were asked I do not know. All I can say is I get hundreds of letters.” He also stated, “It’s very difficult to get all the groups who feel they should have a voice adequately represented.” However, the Deaf community contended that time after time their requests had been ignored. Dave and UAD were explained by Darrell McCarty, an associate state superintendent to make nomination to the governor. He said, “Everyone has the right to make recommendations (Auer, Salt Lake Tribune, August 3, 1986).</p>
		<p>During the same year, Dave worked hard with the state legislature to pass a law to have two deaf persons on the USDB Institutional Council (UAD Bulletin, November 1999). Two deaf individuals, Dr. Robert G. Sanderson and Dennis Platt were appointed to serve on the Institutional Council in 1987.</p>
		<h3>Deaf Served on the USDB Advisory Council</h3>
		<p>The Advisory Council for Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind was established in 1941. Over the years, several Deaf representatives of the Deaf community served on the Advisory Council to give advice and make recommendations to the USDB Superintendent and the Utah State Board of Education. The names of the Council have changed over the years.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Ray G. Wenger (USD ’13) served on the Advisory Council from 1945-1958 and was reappointed in 1958 until 1968.</li>
			<li>Ned C. Wheeler (USD ’33) served on the Governor’s Advisory Council from 1968 - 1981. The Governor’s Advisory Council changed its name to the Institutional Council in 1981. He had served as chairman.</li>
			<li>Dr. Robert G. Sanderson (USD ’36) served on the Institutional Council from 1987 to 1995 and 1995 to 2004. He had served as chairman.</li>
			<li>Dennis Platt served on the Institutional Council from 1987 to 1990 and 1995 to 2008. He had served as chairman.</li>
			<li>Jodi Becker Kinner served on the Institutional Council (later renamed to the Advisory Council) from 2004 to 2008 and was reappointed in 2008 to 2010.			</li>
			<li>Scot Ferre served on the Advisory Council from 2008 to 2012.</li>
			<li>Jeff Pollock served on the Advisory Council from 2011 to 2012.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>A New Deaf Education Program at Utah State University</h3>
		<p>Three years after State Superintendent Dr. Walter D. Talbot sent a letter to Don Logan in 1979, the Utah State Board of Regents granted approval to Utah State University to establish a new deaf education program with an emphasis on Total Communication on April 20, 1982. However, no budget was approved for the program. The aural/oral preparation program (speech, spoken language, listening skills, etc) remained at the University of Utah (G.B. Bitter Papers, 1970).</p>
		<p>After this time, there were no further issues raised by the Utah Association for the Deaf or the Deaf community concerning the University of Utah Teacher Preparation Program (G.B. Bitter, Papers, 1970). Controversy had quiet down (Jeff Pollock, personal communication, May 4, 2005).</p>
		<p>For years, Utah’s total communication teachers came from out of state, with most oral teachers coming from the University of Utah. In 1985, Dr. Thomas Cecil Clark developed a new deaf education program at Utah State University. This program was based on a strong Total Communication basis. Dr. Clark received funding from the U. S. Department of Education for this program. With great support from the UAD, deaf people of Utah, Utah Senator Lyle Hilyard, and Dean Oral Ballam, Utah State University received state funding as the only deaf education program in Utah (Dr. Thomas C. Clark, personal communication, November 13, 2008). It was a victory to UAD. For years, UAD had fought viciously to realize this program. Dr. Thomas Cecil Clark was the founder of the SKI-HI INSTITUTE in Logan in 1972.</p>
		<p>This program served as an Outreach program by providing home-based services to the families of deaf infants and toddlers from birth to 5 years. SKI-HI now serves families of deaf children throughout Utah, the U.S. and several countries. Dr. Clark was also the author and founder of the Deaf Mentor Program.</p>
		<aside>
			<h1>Did you know?</h1>
			<p>Dr. Thomas C. Clark’s father, John Houston (Hout) Clark was among the first member of the Utah Association of the Deaf when it was formed in 1909. John’s first cousin was Elizabeth DeLong the UAD’s first president. They were among the first USD students who graduated from Gallaudet University in 1902 (David Samuelson, personal communication, 2007). [PHOTO]</p>
		</aside>
		<p>This program continues at USU under the direction of Dr. Freeman King as a strong ASL/English bilingual program. He began working at USU in 1991 (UAD Bulletin, October 1991), and immediately re-structuring the program to reflect an ASL/English bilingual philosophy. The first thing that was done (over a period) of years was to gradually eliminate the speech pathology and audiology classes that Deaf Education majors were required to take and substitute them with more pedagogical coursework geared to training teachers, not clinicians. In essence, the program has changed from a pathological model to a socio-cultural model.</p>
		<p>Changing from total communication program to ASL/English bilingual program has also been a gradual process that has been accomplished in the past 18 years. The research indicates that total communication does not provide a complete, full language model in either English or ASL; rather, it is important that languages be separated when used in order for natural language learning to take place. So, the ASL/English bilingual program is based on solid linguistic principles. This program supports the idea that ASL is the true language that deaf children can naturally acquire; then English, primarily in its written form, can be learned. Also, and most importantly, the adult Deaf have been Dr. Freeman’s mentors through the years regarding language teaching and the need for deaf children to have daily access to culture and language; hence, their emphasis on the ASL/English bilingual approach.</p>
		<p>Historically, the typical deaf education teacher-training program has presented a perspective of deafness that has, in turn, produced teachers whose perspective and training has centered around a pathological model of deafness. This perspective of deafness has perpetuated a vicious cycle of erroneous information clothed in half-truths as to who deaf children are and the potential which they have.</p>
		<p>Teacher training programs, in general, have presented a bland menu from which to choose in preparing future teachers of deaf children. We have for too long been content to sacrifice deaf children to the gods of legislative and educational ignorance. It is past time for the profession of teacher training to heed the call for the establishment of new parameters, new ideas, and a fresh sense of purpose as we prepare teachers of the deaf.</p>
		<p>Therefore, the teacher-training program at Utah State University, in keeping with current research and effective classroom practices in the field, has established an ASL/English bilingual model of teacher training. We are accepting the challenge to usher in a new perspective which is shared by many Deaf professionals, teachers of the deaf, administrators, and parents whose collective voice can provide guidance regarding programming, philosophies, goals, and ultimately skills to be developed by students who are preparing to become teachers of deaf children.</p>
		<p>Embedded in the philosophical stance of the Utah State University Teacher Training Program is the fact that deaf children are primarily visual learners and, resultantly, should best be educated via a language that plays to the child's strength (vision), and not his/her weakness (hearing). The language to which we are referring is American Sign Language. This visual language, as evidenced by a culture that is replete with its own rich literature, folklore, history, tradition, poetry, and structure, is fully accessible to any deaf/hard of hearing child.</p>
		<p>The Utah State University teacher training program in Deaf Education prepares teachers who are not only fluent in ASL, but possess the requisite knowledge and training to use ASL to teach academic subjects and literacy in English. The traditional teacher training program trains teachers who possess skills related to audiology and speech pathology and very little training in pedagogy and actual teaching methods. It should be understood that the emphasis of teacher training at Utah State University related to the child who is deaf or hard of hearing is teaching, not therapy.</p>
		<p>Teachers graduating from the Utah State University Deaf Education Teacher Training Program are certified not only in Deaf Education (through the Council on Education of the Deaf (CED), but also in Elementary Education, Secondary Education, or Special Education.</p>
		<p>Also, this program fully supports the use of residual hearing and the teaching of speech, where appropriate. It is the belief of this program that speech and listening skills should be developed within the context of a bilingual approach that utilizes ASL as the language of instruction, and teaches English as a second language. It should be understood that speech is viewed as a tool which can enhance the child's communication with hearing peers and significant others, not as the final product which indicates a complete and appropriate education. Of much greater importance is the mastering of course content and becoming a literate, contributing member of society.</p>
		<p>The faculty supports a program that promotes the use of both ASL and the written form of English. Furthermore, the faculty is supportive of the use of an oral/aural component (where appropriate) within a bilingual context that views the production of spoken English as a valuable tool that can be utilized by the deaf child.</p>
		<p>Certainly, the ultimate goal for deaf children is literacy and an education that is equal in all aspects to that of their hearing peers. In order to facilitate this goal being reached, deaf and hard of hearing children must be afforded the opportunity to become bilingual with instruction, recognition, and respect given to both languages and cultures involved.</p>
		<p>It is the feeling of the Deaf Education faculty that to truly offer deaf and hard of hearing children and their families options, the children and their families must not be forced or coerced to choose between signing and speaking, as has historically been the case. Instead, families can truly offer their children the best of both worlds in a quality bilingual, bicultural program (Dr. Freeman King, personal communication, April 22, 2009).</p>
		<h3>Restructure of Administrative System at the Utah School for the Deaf</h3>
		<p>Between 1986 and 1987, the controversy between the oral and total communication programs continued. When Dr. Thomas Bannister, who knew sign language was appointed as a superintendent at the Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind in 1986, he was appalled at the controversy, especially with biased, one-sided information provided to families (The UAD Bulletin, November 1986). One example from Dr. Jay J. Campbell’s Comprehensive Study back in 1977 was that staff were concerned that Tony Christopulos, as a principal supervising two departments, gave unfair advantage to the oral side, which hurt the Total Communication Department. It was revealed in a variety of situations that he was somewhat less committed to total communication as an educational philosophy (Campbell, 1977). Tony was unable to utilize it himself because he often favored the oral division. Thus, Dr. Bannister shook up the administrative system to end the controversy by changing the position from two principals to one principal to supervise both oral and total communication programs. Tony of the oral program and long time oral advocate was unhappy with the new change, so he resigned and retired (Kenneth L. Kinner, personal communication, May 14, 2011).</p>
		<p>Superintendent Bannister assigned a new principal to charge both oral and total communication programs and established a rule to prohibit bias. When Steven W. Noyce, an oral advocate became a principal of the Deaf Program in Orem, two Deaf leaders, Dave Mortensen and Lloyd Perkins visited the program and found that both oral and total communication classrooms were separated, but for the first time in a long time, the students were allowed to interact during their lunch period and recess as well (Kenneth K. Kinner, personal communication, April 17, 2011).</p>
		<p>Apparently, Dr. Bannister was not aware of Dr. Campbell’s recommendation to USD administration of the two programs be physically separated, not combined under a common principal back in 1977.</p>
		<h3>The Teacher Preparation Program Closes</h3>
		<p>The Teacher Preparation Program in the Department of Special Education at the University of Utah was closed in 1986 after operating for nearly 23 years. Despite Dr. Grant B. Bitter’s appeal letter, “Utah’s Hearing Impaired Children...At Risk!” to Irvin Altman, Vice President of Academic Affairs and numerous supporters that tried to prevent elimination of the program, it was decided the program be closed due to state budgetary limitations, lower student enrollment, and production of fewer teachers and master’s candidates each year (Utah’s Hearing Impaired Children...At High Risk, 1986). Dr. Bitter also requested President Dave Mortensen of Utah Association for the Deaf to give support to the teacher-training program. Dave told him that he and his association would not (Dave Mortensen, personal communication, March 27, 2009). After the teacher preparation program was eliminated, Dr. Bitter retired as Associated Professor of Special Education on June 30, 1987 at the age of 65.</p>
		<h3>Consolidation of Utah Schools for the Deaf and Blind Schools </h3>
		<p>By 1980, enrollment in most of the 61 public and private residential schools had dwindled while the number of day schools, regional program, and mainstream classes increased substantially (Baldwin, 1990).</p>
		<p>This dwindling situation eventually impacted the Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind. In 1986, a proposal to consolidate the USDB in Ogden, Utah was made during the 1986 legislative session. Lawmakers noticed deaf school at 20th Street and Monroe Avenue was half empty, and thought it would be more cost effective to bring the blind school onto the same site at 7th Street and Harrison Boulevard. The budget for the entire program came to about $7.3 million that year (Desert News, September 13, 1986).</p>
		<p>A legislative task force was formed during the summer of 1986 to take a look at the possibility of merging the Utah School for the Deaf and Utah School for the Blind on one campus instead of two. Although the task force didn’t have the knowledge or experience to determine whether the two campuses should be consolidated, they felt that combining two campuses on one campus was cost effective and economically feasible (UAD Bulletin, November 1986). It would save between $110,000 and $130,000 a year, according to Superintendent Thomas Bannister of Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind (UAD Bulletin, July 1987).</p>
		<p>However, officials at the Utah School for the Deaf and the Blind opposed the merging. They feared that consolidating two campuses would jeopardize the quality of service and hurt students in the long run. They urged that the two schools should maintain separate campuses and that the Legislature should seek other ways to save money. The report stated that:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Short-term money concerns should not automatically be the only governing factor in deciding whether or not to combine campuses. Humane factors and long-term finances are also very important factors to be considered.			</li>
			<li>Although enrollments have declined during the past three years at the deaf school while the extension program was being organized, they are now on the upswing and expected to rise for the next four years.</li>
			<li>The building the blind school would occupy on the deaf school campus is too small for their needs, and the cost to enlarge and refurnish it with the necessary equipment would be more expensive than maintaining a separate campus.</li>
			<li>Bringing deaf and blind students together would harm their progress because the two disabilities make it impossible for students to communicate with each other (Deseret News, September 13, 1986).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The Utah Council of the Blind reported in the letter that “those of us who are blind have never been able to understand why anyone...would see to connect two completely opposite handicaps.” They also stated that no state-run deaf and blind programs in the nation have been consolidated since 1912 (Ipaktchian, 1986).</p>
		<p>In July of 1987, legislature recommended the schools be consolidated. In September of that year the consolidation was approved with the stipulation that funding be provided for remodeling and maintenance of separate facilities on the same campus (UAD Bulletin, October 1987; The UAD Bulletin, October 1988).</p>
		<p>Thus, the proposal to consolidate the Utah School for the Deaf and the Utah School for the Blind on one campus had been given backing by the Institutional Council, formally known as Governor’s Advisory Council and by the Utah State Board of Education. The proposal, then went through the Utah legislature (The UAD Bulletin, October 1987).</p>
		<h3>A New Location for the Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind</h3>
		<p>Since 1986, a variety of boards and state agencies wrestled with the question of whether to consolidate the two Ogden campuses for the Utah Schools for the Deaf and Blind, how to do it, and even whether to close both schools and move to Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
		<p>Closing both Ogden campuses and moving to Salt Lake City was argued on the basis of the fact that most students registered at USDB came from the Salt Lake area. President Dave Mortensen of Utah Association for the Deaf voiced his support of USDB being built on a new campus adjacent to a new facility for the Utah Community Center of the Deaf. USDB and UCCD could share the proposed pool and gym. The school would use this most heavily during the day and the UCCD could use them in the evenings. Students would benefit from transitional activities that would help facilitate going from school to adult life. The costs associated with acquiring property and building new facilities for deaf and blind schools would be expensive. It was clear that Utah could not afford to keep a whole separate school and campus for a mere handful of deaf student, especially when most of them were served in a public school system (UAD Bulletin, October 1988).</p>
		<p>In February of 1988, $50,000 was provided in planning funds. Design West was contracted to submit various architectural designs that would accommodate children who were deaf, blind, deaf/blind or autistic on campus (The UAD Bulletin, March 1988).</p>
		<p>Hence, on September 28, 1988, the Institutional Council rejected moving to Salt Lake City and approved a merger of the deaf and blind schools. They recommended the USDB remain in Ogden instead of Salt Lake City, despite the majority of deaf students living in the Salt Lake area (Leer, November 1, 1988, p. B1; Deseret News, November 4, 1988, p. A10). They originally supported the merger, but with the idea that the deaf campus would be the one to remain. Some parents fought the same idea (Deseret News, November 4, 1988, p. A10).</p>
		<p>On November 11, 1988, the Institutional Council’s recommendation was presented to the Utah State Board of Education. The Utah State Board of Education approved the consolidation at the present blind school campus in Ogden. Some representatives from the Deaf community presented a petition to the board opposing closure of the deaf school and relocation to the blind campus (Leer, November 2, 1988).</p>
		<p>Prior to the Utah State Board of Education meeting, the legislature provided funding for a study of the consolidation issue for a year. However, the Salt Lake option was not included in the study. That study recommended combining the schools at the blind school campus in Ogden. It would be a less traumatic move for the deaf students compared to the blind students because the blind students would have a difficult time coping with new and different surroundings. The 100-year-old rich history campus of the Utah School for the Deaf would be closed and for the Ogden School District to take over the parcels of land and building (Leer, November 2, 1988).</p>
		<p>The decision was to construct and renovate a new facility on the blind school campus on 742 Harrison Blvd. The consolidation issue was urgent because some buildings on the two campuses were out of compliance with fire and safety codes (Leers, November 1, 1988, p. B1). Superintendent Thomas Bannister stated that Ogden officials did not want to spend several hundred thousand dollars to bring them into compliance if money could be obtained to consolidate the schools at one site (Leer, November 2, 1988). They would not act on the code violation if a decision about the future location of the schools was still up in the air.</p>
		<p>The merger proposal was an emotional one for many people. It was difficult to justify two separate campuses when the student population was so small. At that time, the number of students who were deaf and blind was decreasing. The deaf and blind schools combined served about 40 residential students whose disabilities were severe enough that they could not be taught in the regular school system. Less than 10 deaf students were in the residential program. Around 100 day school students attended classes at the two sites. Combining the two school campuses did not mean that the deaf and blind programs themselves would be combined (Leers, November 1, 1988, p. B1; Deseret News, November 4, 1988).</p>
		<p>Two Utah State Board of Education members, Margaret Nelson and Dr. M. Richard Maxwell, opposed the decision, arguing the merged schools should be located in Salt Lake City, due to lack of firm details, including potential cost. One representative of the Salt Lake Deaf community, Kleda Quigley, told board members the schools would better serve the Deaf community if they were moved to Salt Lake City (UAD Bulletin, December 1988).</p>
		<p>Nevertheless, most of the Institutional Council members changed their mind and voted three to one to recommend to the Utah Board of Education that the school be located on the blind school campus. Dennis Platt, Council member was the only one who voted to shift the services for both deaf and blind students to the school campus for the deaf, 846 20th Street in Ogden. He cast the dissenting vote in favor of tradition. He insisted that the school remain at its current site where the deaf and blind schools had their origins more than half a century ago (UAD Bulletin, December 1988).</p>
		<p>Majority of the members of the Institutional Council felt the blind school campus offered the greatest advantage for deaf and blind students and the campus setting offered room for expansion. Additionally, it was located within close proximity to Ben Lomond High School, Highland Middle School and Horace Mann Elementary School, offering advantages for mainstreaming, a concept in educating deaf and blind students that had been successfully implemented in the past two decades (UAD Bulletin, December 1988).</p>
		<p>The approved site for the new dual school campus was on Harrison Boulevard in order to build comprehensive new facility for the deaf, blind, deafblind and autistic population. The facility would include a resource/media center and an addition to the existing multipurpose building, an administration center, residential cottages, and more (UAD Bulletin, February 1989).</p>
		<p>The Utah State Board of Education Board’s decision went through the Division of Facilities Construction Management and then to the legislative interim committee in December 1988. The funding request would be presented to the 1989 session of the Utah Legislature to finance the total relocation. (UAD Bulletin, December 1988).</p>
		<p>The reasons given for the merger of two campuses were the dwindling enrollment of residential students, the unused space at the Utah School for the Deaf and the excessive cost of bringing its buildings in compliance with state codes.</p>
		<p>In 1989, Superintendent Bannister was hired as president of the Alabama School for the Deaf and Blind. His departure from USDB came in the midst of planning for the consolidation of state deaf and blind schools on one campus. According to Assistant Superintendent Lee Robinson, Bannister’s legacy would be the unification of the two programs and the emergence of the schools as a state resource center (UAD Bulletin, December 1989).</p>
		<p>In 1990, David West replaced Thomas Bannister. As a deaf education teacher and administrator in various state schools for the deaf, he communicated fluently in American Sign Language (UAD Bulletin, May 1990).</p>
		<h3>Integration of Public Schools and the Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind</h3>
		<p>While mainstreaming had continued to grow steadily since the 1960s, the situation is an example of how the concept of integration in a mainstreamed setting was so popular in Utah.</p>
		<p>In June 1989, the Utah School for the Deaf Institutional Council was planning to present to the legislature a proposed architectural plan of consolidations of the new schools for the deaf and the blind. However, the plan was interrupted by a petition signed by twenty-five parents of Utah School for the Deaf students. The petition requested that their children be transferred to a selected public elementary school by September of that year. They believed their children would benefit from social and cultural interaction with hearing peers. When he handed the petition to the Institutional Council, Dr. John Galli, an Ogden resident told the Institutional Council “We’re not talking mainstreaming; we’re talking integration” (Deseret News, June 15, 1989, p. A19; UAD Bulletin, October 1989).</p>
		<p>Upon the parents’ request, students would continue to have teachers and administrators from Utah School for the Deaf, but their classrooms would be housed on a regular campus so that they could be integrated for lunch, recesses and those classes they would be able to join. Superintendent Bannister stated the parents might feel more comfortable having their children in public schools, rather than at the “school for the deaf	" or "institution," phrases which, to them, may carry a negative connotation (Deseret News, June 15, 1989, p. A19; UAD Bulletin, October 1989).</p>
		<p>Because of the parents’ desire for integration, USD administrators talked with representatives from school districts about placing extension classes in their schools to accommodate the current USD students. However, critics from the Deaf community said the students would feel alienated and isolated. Additionally, critics stated that they attended public schools themselves as children and felt isolated and ostracized. Dr. Robert G. Sanderson said that deaf children are happiest with each other, and that they would immediately form a clique at the new school (Deseret News, June 15, 1989, p. A19; UAD Bulletin, October 1989).</p>
		<p>While it was proposed integration of the elementary egement of the Utah School for the Deaf into the public school system, a deaf representative, Shirley Platt expressed her strong concern about the deaf children’s emotional and social well-being:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>There has always been a solid front in the Deaf community. It has existed since Laurent Clerc, a deaf man, began the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, CT in 1817. The Deaf community with its own culture, history and language has been a frontrunner in the establishment of long successful organizations of by and for the deaf, as compared to other disabled groups. Other disabled groups in sports, for example, (i.e. Paralympics) did not begin organizing until the 1970’s and later.</p>
			<p>Still hearing people try to tell us what to do, how to do it, how to live our lives and how to educate “our” children. If we deaf adults are bitter, it is NOT because our parents were never told about sign language or deaf schools and thus never had that option to consider. My deaf sister and I are certainly not bitter towards our family. My parents know now that many things they had to do the past were not right – especially our education in a public school.</p>
			<p>We are fed up with seeing “our” deaf children repeatedly used as guinea pigs in the state of Utah, while different groups test different theories and systems. These are kids lives you are playing with, they are not laboratory animals to be tests on a whim. Giving birth to a deaf child, doesn’t give one the experience or know-how to deal with or educate a deaf child. Proven research has stated repeatedly that deaf children do better with deaf peers and role models in schools for the deaf. What’s more, our deaf school, is NOT an institution in the antiquated sense that language implies – it is ridiculous stigma and these parents just don’t want it known their children are there. They are embarrassed – but why? These are NOT little imitation hearing children. These are deaf children who will ALWAYS be deaf, so let them be.</p>
			<p>If the parents feel the program needs changing, why not start at USD, where even some teachers are not totally educated in deafness and the deaf culture; where our sign language is abused to the point that teachers make up signs, use wrong concepts and destroy the meaning and beauty of American Sign Langauge; where there is a program coordinator who many of us feel does not even support the program and is not impartial, but blatantly supports an oral philosophy; where former students have left because there is no sports program anymore or because of the former superintendents; and now where parents want to pull out an entire elementary program to give their children a dream world of what could but never will be, promoted by a few misguided individuals; and yet, sadly, USD is the place where many successful deaf Utahns grew up in the 50’s, 60’s, and 70’s, not with happy memories of their abuse by cruel former school administrators, but instead of their large association and social life with other deaf children and adult role models.</p>
			<p>Superintendent Thomas Bannister is the best thing that ever happened to this school, so why not work to rebuild it?</p>
			<p>Shirley H. Platt<br>Ogden</p>
			<p>(Platt, UAD Bulletin, August 1989, p. 2)</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The Deaf community’s concerns were ignored and USD parents’ wishes were granted by enrolling students in school districts. As discussed in the Deseret News newspaper on August 28, 1989, this could be the last year deaf students attend USD site when they had already started classes that Monday (UAD Bulletin, October 1989).</p>
		<p>At that time, there were 35 residential students on the deaf school campus, and between 45-50 students at the Utah School for the Blind. During the 1990 legislative session, the Institutional Council gave a fact sheet about the Utah School for the Deaf and the Blind to budget-minded legislators and hoped to convince them the facilities were not small schools that just served Ogden. However, Rep. Haze Hunter, chair of the appropriations subcommittee on capital facilities and general government, didn’t feel the cost of $8.1 million for the consolidation was justified. He questioned, “Do we really want to spend $8.1 million on 35 students?”(UAD Bulletin, February 1990).</p>
		<p>After the petition signed by 25 parents of USD in 1989 and their children being placed in a mainstreamed setting, only about 35 students lived on the deaf school campus while 916 (including blind) statewide students attended the extension programs (UAD Bulletin, February 1990).</p>
		<p>With a large number of deaf children being mainstreamed, the USD alumni were sadly watching the school and its evolution of deaf education slowly change over the years. They had fond memories at school. For years, USD provided them a full and accessible environment that supported their language, communication, literacy, academic, social, and emotional development, and provided them with the support services they need to become educated, successful, and contributing adults. They were heartbroken to see the future generation of deaf children would not share the same opportunity and experience they had at the school.</p>
		<h3>Groundbreaking for the New Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind Facility</h3>
		<p>The groundbreaking ceremony for a new facility of the Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind took place October 1, 1991 on the campus at 742 Harrison Boulevard in Ogden.</p>
		<p>The Utah legislature had appropriated $8.4 million to complete the first phase of the new 91,000 square foot facility. The merged school included an education resource center, outreach services, educational support services, and distribution center, administrative offices, a media-library center, a cafeteria and conference rooms, and cottages for residential students.</p>
		<p>Numerous state and local school officials, members of the Legislature, representatives of the governor’s office, the Ogden City Council members, representatives from the teachers’ training program at Utah State University, and some member from the Deaf community joined the teachers and numerous students at the one-hour ceremony. Jean Thomas served as an interpreter.</p>
		<p>One of the speakers, chairman of the USDB Institutional Council and former student of USDB, Jack Wheeler, outlined the history of the school. He remembered when USDB on the 20th Street campus was self-sufficient with its own barn and garden. He touched upon nostalgia reflections of his school days. USDB was undergoing changes that were happening at that time.</p>
		<p>David West, USDB Superintendent, pointed out the long work that went into making the concept of a new consolidated school a reality. He reassured those present that the schools for the deaf and the blind would remain separate, even on the same campus.</p>
		<p>Interesting historical facts popped up. The USDB at the time was 107 years old. Kenneth C. Burdett, who was present, first enrolled at USDB 75 years ago. Dr. Thomas Clark who was also there said his father, John H. Clark enrolled at USDB 105 years ago. The groundbreaking ceremony represented an important milestone in their lives. As the shovels dug into the ground, the students let go a multitude of red, white, and blue balloons up into the sky (UAD Bulletin, October 1991; UAD Bulletin, November 1991).</p>
		<h3>USDB Gets New Classrooms</h3>
		<p>The original plans for the few facility finalized in 1987 did not include classrooms, in part because Superintendent David West reported that students, mostly deaf, were moving out of Utah at that time and in part because officials continued to try to integrate children with disabilities into regular schools whenever possible (UAD Bulletin, May 1993).</p>
		<p>Because Utah’s population continued to grow rapidly, Superintendent West asked for Phase II funding for the new nearly completed facility on Harrison Boulevard during the 1993 Legislative Session. The Phase II funding would allow Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind to complete the new facility by adding 21 classrooms and associated offices, proceed with the expansion of the dining area, and build a community room for the blind and a community room for the deaf (UAD Bulletin, May 1993).</p>
		<p>The request for the building bond for the new classrooms had a rocky passage in the legislature (UAD Bulletin, March 1993).</p>
		<p>One time the request was 38th on the list of priorities. Over a period of time, it was moved closer up to the top 20. As of February 17, it merited a 15th place. If the Phase II request reached the top ten by the time it went through the executive appropriations committee, the House and the Senate, the Phase II request would get the funding. Then the USDB would stop worrying about where to place the deaf and blind campus students for the next few years, a crisis that Superintendent West was facing at that time (UAD Bulletin, March 1993).</p>
		<p>The entire office and personnel and the education resource center moved into the new facility in March – April 1993. The students and teachers, both deaf and blind, remained on the present campus on 20th Street. They were concerned how long they would remain there, because the Ogden School District, the owner of the USDB campus on the 20th and Monroe Boulevard, was anxious to take up the spaced occupied by the teachers and students (UAD Bulletin, May 1993).</p>
		<p>After some close calls on the legislative chopping block, the USDB got $3.4 million to build classrooms for the deaf and the blind on its new Ogden campus at 742 Harrison Boulevard (UAD Bulletin, May 1993). That was a cause for cheer. There was a true need for those planned 21 classrooms (UAD Bulletin, 1993).</p>
		<p>Utah State Board of Education sold the old campus to the Ogden School District, which planned to use its buildings for vocational education programs and other projects. The Ogden School District could not wait for the students and teachers to vacate the premises. They had a great need for their own buildings (UAD Bulletin, May 1993).</p>
		<p>USDB was grateful for the wise decision of the 1993 Legislature to grant the USDB the money for the new classrooms (UAD Bulletin, May 1993).</p>
		<h3>Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind Move to New Campus </h3>
		<p>On April 19, 1993, the Ogden campus of Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind on 846 20th Street was vacated and the new facility on the new 13.5 acre campus at 742 Harrison Blvd was occupied.</p>
		<p>During the three-week process of moving, USDB Superintendent David West stated that the new $8 million facility was at the site of a demolished state hospital for tuberculosis patients. It later served as the Utah School for the Blind until a decision was made to tear down the building and the deaf and blind schools were consolidated on 20th Street.</p>
		<p>The new campus became a state-of-the-art educational resource library capable of supplying teachers with textbooks, technology and other supplies helpful in teacher deaf and blind students in public schools statewide. Additionally, the facility offered hearing and vision testing services, computer learning labs, conference rooms, administrative offices, and a program that teaches new parents how to work with their deaf or blind infants.</p>
		<p>The facility was designed carefully so that it could best serve the needs of students. For instance, the building was built to avoid a need for stairs in order to meet the accessibility needs of students with disabilities. The swimming pool was used for both recreation and therapy purposes, and a gymnasium-multipurpose room with a stage that was used for student theater productions. A water fountain in one corridor was included so the sound of flowing water oriented the blind students and staff to where they were in the building. A clock with a loud tick was placed in another key hallway for the same purpose. One side of the main facility was for students with autistic and students with multiple disabilities was another, around the nurses’ quarters so someone would be readily available to meet their needs.</p>
		<p>A series of cottages were built to provide home homes to students who lived on campus. Cottages represented an attempt to make the campus more like home to students who lived there. A team made up of each student’s parents, teachers, and therapists had determined it was best for their educational development. At that time, about 35 students who lived at USDB currently resided in dormitories. About five or six students lived in each cottage.</p>
		<p>Besides the 35 cottage students, about 100 other students were day students at the campus, while USDB also served 900 deaf and blind students in schools throughout Utah (UAD Bulletin, May 1993).</p>

			<p>When the Ogden City School District took over the parcels of land and building, they turned Driggs Hall into their new office building. Woodbury Hall is no longer used formally, but still stands on the campus. The Main Building, restored with many new walls and hallways, is now set up with many more offices and class rooms. The Vocational Building is now being used for other things within the district offices. USD alumni asked the district in 1986 to allow them to tour the 100 years old school buildings, to help them remember the memories they all had there. However, after the 1986 USD reunion, the district requested the alumni not to take any more tours. Now they rely on pictures and stories told between friends (Utah School for the Deaf Alumni Reunion, 2009).</p>

		<h3>Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind Serve as a State Institutional Resource</h3>
		<p>The trend in the nation indicated most state residential schools function as centers of education for the majority of the deaf children in their state, with a few attending a public school nearby. Students who were mainstreamed in school districts tend to be taken care of by the respective public school districts. Like USDB, these state schools also served as an agency.</p>
		<p>Utah had functioned exactly the opposite of that trend. USD indicated the reverse: most of its deaf and hard of hearing students were mainstreamed, often in self-contained public school classrooms staffed by USD personnel. These deaf and hard of hearing students, while being classified as mainstreamed, were counted separately from the mainstreamed students who choose to be placed under school districts rather than under USD, and were considered USDB students (Sanderson, UAD Bulletin, April 2001).</p>
		<p>Before Jean Massieu School of the Deaf merged with USDB in 2005, only a handful of students attended the residential campus on 742 Harrison Blvd in Ogden, despite a beautiful building full of classrooms and cottages full of bedrooms.</p>
		<p>Because 90% of deaf and hard of hearing students registered with USD were scattered throughout the state of Utah in various school districts. USD provided educational services and consulting to non-USD students who were deaf and hard of hearing as well as to their families and service providers in school district. Because of this, the state of Utah determined that USDB would serve as a State Institutional Resource, commonly known as an agency, to the educational programs for deaf and hard of hearing children (Sanderson, UAD Bulletin, April 2001; McAllister, 2002).</p>
		<p>USDB was no longer a school. Ron Nelson (2002), UAD President learned that USDB’s mission had been defined as a statewide educational resource and that USDB no longer had to compete with school districts for money. He also shared that USDB can allocate its resource where they were most-needed and sharpen its focus on serving deaf, blind, and deaf-blind students. They also can provide services to any school that makes a request, including Jean Massieu School of the Deaf (UAD Bulletin, December 2002).</p>
		<p>There were some pitfalls with having the statewide “authority” on deaf education considered an agency instead of a school. Unlike local school districts, USDB was listed as a state agency that didn’t have a local tax base. USDB could not compete with school districts for money. Legislatively, finances could be cut from an agency’s budget due to state restrictions on finances; USD would then have inadequate funding and run the risk of being in violation of federal law and state special education rules (Toomer-Cook, 2001). However, school budgets were rarely, if ever, reduced, especially in the state of Utah. Second, having USD fulfill its duties as an agency meant that there was one fewer option in the continuum of educational services that had been mandated to deaf and hard of hearing students. A final downside was USD’s apparent reduced accountability for the results of the education it provided. For instance, the test scores of deaf and hard of hearing students in self contained classrooms were combined with the scores of other students with disabilities of the public school that housed the self-contained classroom instead of being amassed by USD, there was no way to extract the scores of their students from the scores of other students with disabilities.</p>
		<p>In Utah, when Individualized Education Program teams discussed alternative educational placement options, regular classrooms known as mainstream were automatically viewed as LRE (Least Restrictive Environment).</p>
		<p>In 2000, a special education attorney, Lawrence Siegel, who had worked on both individual cases and systemic reform, particularly in the field of deaf education, stated that an educational system can and must become communication-driven for deaf and hard of hearing children and the IEP process communication-driven as well. This is fundamentally an issue of human rights. Additionally, Siegel stated that deaf and hard of hearing children have one thing in common: their universal need for communication, from which all programmatic, fiscal, and educational determinations should flow.</p>
		<p>Since IDEA mandates a continuum of equal and appropriate education placement options, Utah needs a statewide residential school where students are treated equally, as in public schools. Like other school districts, USD can also receive educational guarantees under IDEA with annual secured adequate. In fact, Siegel (2000) states that there should be no legal or fiscal disincentives for placing children in special schools.</p>
		<h3>Commission on Education of the Deaf</h3>
		<p>Since the passing Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1975, the National Association of the Deaf witnessed a speedy and constant deterioration in the quality of educational services offered to the deaf children across the nation. Gary Olsen in ‘Definitely Ours’ in the February 1989 issue of “The NAD Broadcaster” inserted the following rights of deaf and hard of hearing children were being denied:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The right of parents to be made aware of all the educational placement options and learning strategies available for their child at the onset of their child’s education and at every Individualized Educational Planning meeting after that, so that parents are remained of placement options.					</li>
			<li>The right of the child to have full support services at any one of these placements and not be cheated by programs that have only some of the services needed. This includes teachers with competent communication skills’ aides with competent communication skills; interpreter services by a competent and qualified interpreter of the deaf (given the child is in a mainstreamed class setting, deaf and hard of hearing awareness programs available for teachers and children in regular education settings; speech therapists with training in deafness, deaf heritage programs for the deaf and hard of hearing students themselves; and the right for these children to have access to their own peers with whom they can communicate.</li>
			<li>The right to have a “barrier-free” language environment with every child entitled to live in an environment where they can freely, continually and appropriately receive and express communication.</li>
			<li>The right to have knowledgeable individuals monitoring these programs and that such individuals, at various levels of administration within school districts, have background knowledge and certification in programs related to deafness.	</li>
			<li>The right to have programs large enough in size to provide the appropriate educational and social environment for the deaf and hard of hearing children (UAD Bulletin, April 1989, p.6).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In the eyes of the Deaf community, the least restrictive environment is viewed as the “most restrictive environment” for many deaf children who utilize American Sign Language. In the mainstreaming system, many deaf children experienced isolate from their peers, deprive them of deaf adult role models, and also prevent them from acquiring American Sign Language throughout their school years (Erting et al., 1989).</p>
		<p>Legislators and educators were aware of low academic achievement levels of deaf and hard of hearing children and Congress passed the Education of the Deaf Act in 1986, which establishing the Commission on Education of the Deaf (COED) to study the status of deaf education in the United States and to recommend creative solutions (NASDSE Educational Services Guidelines, 2006).</p>
		<p>COED was established after the Babbidge Committee formed by the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare in 1965. The Baddidge Committee concluded that the educational system had limited success in preparing deaf children for full participation in society (Siegel, 2000).</p>
		<p>After over eighteen months of meeting comprised of a significant number of deaf members, on February 4, 1988, the COED committee, chaired by Frank Bowe, Father of Section 504, formally submitted report to the President and Congress expressing dissatisfaction with the status of deaf education. Their report, Toward Equality: Education of the Deaf contained numerous findings and recommendations on a national level. The conclusion of COED’s 144-page report stated the deaf educational system, in all of its forms, did not provide appropriate and acceptable levels of achievement for deaf children (Commission on Education of the Deaf, 1988; UAD Bulletin, June 1988).</p>
		<p>COED reported that the status of education for deaf children was unacceptable and recommended fundamental changes in how educational services were delivered to deaf and hard of hearing children, including changes in the way Individuals with Disabilities Education Act were applied to these children. COED felt the system had pushed too hard to “mainstream” deaf children into regular public school classes instead of special schools or centers devoted to the deaf. COED said schools should “pay attention to educational content rather than mere placement to what is taught rather than where it is taught.” Furthermore, COED emphasized more attention must be paid to deaf children who are not college bound (Deseret News, March 21, 1988, p. A2).</p>
		<p>The report ruled that Least Restrictive Environment mandated by Individuals with Disabilities Education Act needed to be clarified by the federal government, particularly the U.S. Department of Education (Baldwin, 1990; NASDSE Educational Services Guidelines, 2006). Currently, IDEA does not use “mainstreaming” or “full inclusion.” The regulations require that available a continuum of alternative placements being offered to meet the needs of children with disabilities, including students who are deaf and hard of hearing, for special education and related services (NASDSE Educational Services Guidelines, 2006).</p>
		<p>COED criticized the system for failing to recognize and utilize American Sign Language and the Deaf community as a resource for education of deaf children:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Almost unrecognized is the legitimate status of American Sign Language (ASL) as a full-fledged native minority language to which all of the provisions of the Bilingual Education Act should apply. Also too seldom recognized is the need for a deaf child to have other deaf children as part of his or her peer group, and to be exposed to deaf adults (1988, p. 9).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Because the report applied to Utah, Dave Mortensen, president of Utah Association of the Deaf proposed the Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind Institutional Council to select a committee to review the Commission on Education of the Deaf report and its findings. Four deaf persons Dave Mortensen, Lloyd Perkins, Ron Nelson, and Dennis Platt were selected by USDB Superintendent Thomas Bannister to serve on the committee of sixteen. Dave felt one-fourth representation from the deaf wasn’t fair. (UAD Bulletin, January 1989; UAD Bulletin, February 1989). The committee studied the “Toward Equality” report and came up with recommendations to the Utah State Board of Education for changes in laws and other rulings regarding education of deaf children of mainstreamed and residential status.</p>
		<p>On September 7, 1989, the Institutional Council accepted the recommendations and passed them unanimously. After recommendations were presented to the Utah State Board of Education in October 1989; however, no progress was made (UAD Bulletin, October 1988, p. 4).</p>

		<h3>Mainstreaming Is Not the Answer for All Deaf Children</h3>
		<p>When the Utah School for the Deaf became a State Institutional Resource, the Institutional Council’s February 1992 meeting went on record “that students need to be mainstreamed to the maximum when possible.” Dr. Robert G. Sanderson, a former member of the USDB Institutional Council read the Council’s two pages statement on mainstreaming and expressed his concerns in the UAD Bulletin that mainstreaming is not the answer for all deaf children. He expressed his concerns in several areas:</p>
		<ol>
			<li> USD’s practice of mainstreaming the majority of their deaf students</li>
			<li>inappropriately biased educational placement</li>
			<li>improper, biased, and one-sided educational information for parents that lacked a research base.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In the <em>UAD Bulletin</em> of 1992, Dr. Sanderson stated that he did not believe that all deaf children should be mainstreamed. In his professional career as an educator and as a rehabilitation counselor, he was privileged to work with and for hundreds of deaf people, and saw the results of every possible educational program and philosophy. He saw the successes and failures, teenagers and adults, and helped many to further their education and training, and placed many in jobs.</p>
		<p>He was acutely aware of the emotional investment that parents of deaf children had in them. He understood that parents wanted their deaf children to be educated “normally” much the same as their hearing children were, in schools close to home. He was also aware that a great many, not just a few, parents came to realized that their children had been short-changed educationally and socially in public school programs that were not appropriate for them to begin with.</p>
		<p>Further, Dr. Sanderson noticed that there had been lack, strong, consistent effort by the state of Utah to evaluate the results of either oral or total communication in the mainstreamed programs. His experience as a researcher some years ago at Gallaudet University was that the very word “research” rang alarm bells among school people and parents, and he was amazed and dismayed that so many seemed to be deathly afraid of facts. He shared his personal view that research be conducted to learn about the USD’s programs. If research indicates that a program, whether total communication or oral, or a mainstreamed version, was having problems, then the state would be better situated to address and solve them. What is there to fear?</p>
		<p>Dr. Sanderson clarified that he was not opposed to the right of parents of deaf children to decide on a program for them, based on fair information. He was certainly opposed to improper, biased, one-sided information that lacks research basis. His heart went out to parents who had to make decisions based on conflicting advice from so-called professionals.</p>
		<p>Finally, Dr. Sanderson let it be known that he was what may be called a “mainstreamed failure” or “integrated failure.” He was in the eighth grade when he became deaf at age eleven from spinal meningitis. Since Las Vegas, Nevada had no school for the deaf at the time, he was returned to the same class that he had been attending prior to his illness. His classmates tried to help; his teachers tried to help; he was given lots of attention and still could not hack it. On advice of the teachers and the school principal, he was sent to the Utah School for the Deaf in Ogden, Utah.</p>
		<p>Since then he had experienced the residential environment at the USD and his USD experience from 1931 to 1936 influenced him to be a serious, disciplined student.</p>
		<p>Hence, Dr. Sanderson believed that given an educational appropriate to the child’s natural abilities and perceptive placement, parental encouragement and teacher encouragement, the deaf child may have a wonderful educational experience ahead. He emphasized not to limit the child by continuing bad placements far beyond the time when it becomes obvious the kid is not hacking it (UAD Bulletin, March 1992).</p>
		<p>Fifteen years later in 2007, the Conference of Educational Administrators of Schools and Programs for the Deaf said the same thing when it mentioned that a “least restrictive environment” was not a generic concept or a “one-size fits all,” but a concept that could be used depending on each child’s individual communication, language and educational needs, not the other way around (CEASD Position Paper, February 2007).</p>
		<h3>American Sign Language Fights for Recognition in Utah’s Colleges and Universities</h3>
		<p>While oralism and mainstreaming continued to grow steadily in Utah, American Sign Language had been shown and proven to be the language of the American Deaf community in 1960s and 1970s (Lucas &#38; Valli, 1992; Stokoe, 1960, among many others). Linguistic research had shown ASL to be a true language (Klima, &#38; Bellugi, 1979; Wilcox, S. &#38; Peyton, 1999, to name a few sources). The linguists discovered that ASL had its own grammar and met the universal criteria for a human language. In addition, it has its own phonology, morphology, semantics, syntax, and pragmatics (Stokoe, 1960).</p>
		<p>Dr. William C. Stokoe, a hearing professor of English at Gallaudet College and linguistic researcher is credited for his initial work in 1950s. While he was employed at Gallaudet College, he became fascinated with the graceful sign language students used outside of the classroom. He began to study linguistic, especially the students of deaf parents. Gallaudet frowned on his study; he was ridiculed by deaf and hearing colleagues, but he continued to persist in his work (Erting et al, 1989). In 1960, he published a seminal paper, “Sign Language Structure” urging that ASL was, indeed, a true language on a par with any spoken language. In addition, ASL was proven to be a complex, three-dimensional language (Stokoe, Casterline, &#38; Croneberg, 1965). Dr. Stokoe’s hard work paid off when the foundation for a new generation of linguistic studies of sign languages and Deaf communities as well as a new movement in the deaf educational system to bring ASL back into the classroom (Erting et al., 1989).</p>
		<h4> Weber State University</h4>
		<p>In November 1990, Bill Vicars who was the first Deaf person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree from Weber State University and a founder and ASL instructor of the Sign Language Studio, attended the 1990 Utah Intercollegiate Assembly at the University of Utah (Rees, UAD Bulletin, March 1993). Over 60 resolutions were proposed by representatives from various colleges throughout Utah. There, Dr. Vicars proposed a resolution that American Sign Language be allowed to fulfill Bachelor of Arts degree and graduate school entrance language requirements in all Utah Public Institutions of Higher Education. The ASL resolution took top place. In the meantime, Dr. Vicars was seeking a state legislator to sponsor the ASL resolution (UAD Bulletin, December 1990).</p>
		<p>However, Dr. Vicars faced a challenging situation with Dr. Robert Belka, head of the foreign language department at Weber State University for refusing to recognize ASL as a foreign language to fill the requirement for a bachelor’s of arts degree at that university. While Dr. Vicars served as Weber’s Physically Challenged Students Senator, he attempted to fulfill ASL as a foreign language credit at that university, Dr. Belka stated that, “A move to recognize the American Sign Language as a foreign language to fill the requirement for a bachelor’s of arts degree at Weber State University has met opposition in the foreign language department.” Additionally, Dr. Belka said, “ASL is not recognized as a foreign language because it does not meet the four criteria inherent to a language: being able to hear it, read it, write it, and speak it.” He believed the sound of a language is ‘probably the most important’ aspect of a language. Dr. Belka said, ‘If you take sound away from a symphony, you have nothing. Take away sound and where’s the beauty of language?’ (UAD Bulletin, November 1990, p. 7).</p>
		<p>In October 1991, the foreign language department at the Weber State University finally accepted ASL as the equivalent for a foreign language. However, Dr. Belka imposed two conditions on granting the special foreign language credit to the deaf students who asked for it. The conditions were, as quoted by Belka, “that the student can verify a 30% hearing loss in both ears or 100% loss in one through a certified audiologist, and receives verification from an official agency that he/she is proficient in ASL at the Intermediate Level survival skills” (UAD Bulletin, October 1991, p. 6).</p>
		<p>Dr. Vicars was not satisfied and took extra steps by contacting Utah Governor Norman Bangerter for support for allowing the ASL to fulfill foreign language requirements at Utah’s colleges and universities. Governor Bangerter responded that the Deputy Commissioner for Higher Education would reopen the discussion regarding credit for ASL as foreign language later this fall, which eventually accepted (McKeller, UAD Bulletin, March 1991).</p>
		<h4>Brigham Young University</h4>
		<p>While Weber State University struggled to convince curriculum managers to accept ASL as a foreign language, Brigham Young University accepted ASL as an elective that fulfills general education language credit in 1990, after being a language course for more than 10 years.</p>
		<p>Jack Rose, coordinator of ASL said in his interview in March 1991 that, “There was never a sufficient avenue for ASL to get serious consideration. We recommended it for many years, but until last year it hadn’t been proposed the way it should have been” (UAD Bulletin, March 1991, p. 1).</p>
		<h3>Utah Senate Bill 42</h3>
		<p>During the 1994 Legislative session, the Utah Senate Bill 42 was proposed to recognize American Sign Language as a creditable foreign language that can be taken in secondary and postsecondary institutions along with other foreign language. This bill passed through the Senate and House very easily. Utah joined numerous other states when its senate passed Utah Senate Bill 42 (53A-13-101.5), which recognizes ASL as a fully developed, autonomous, natural language with distinct grammar, syntax and art forms, and provides that American Sign Language shall be accorded equal status with other linguistic systems in the state’s public and higher education systems in 1994. In the public educational system, the majority of sign language interpreters who learned ASL as a second language did not have fluent ASL skills to be able to effectively interpret on an academic level. Thus, deaf students placed in mainstream classrooms quickly fell behind and failed to receive an education equal to their hearing peers (Jeff Pollock, personal communication, May 4, 2005).</p>

		<p>With the increasing support of the research and the ASL community, Utah joined numerous other states when its senate passed Utah Senate Bill 42 (53A-13-101.5), which recognizes ASL as a fully developed, autonomous, natural language with distinct grammar, syntax and art forms, and provides that American Sign Language shall be accorded equal status with other linguistic systems in the state's public and higher education systems in 1994 (Utah State Legislature, 1994). This bill was signed into law by Governor Leavitt on March 2, 1994. Kristi Mortensen, as a former member of the House Bill 167 Task Force created in 1993 to study the issue of interpreter certification and standards, the Senate Bill 42 was a direct result of the Task Force (Mortensen, UAD Bulletin, April 1994).</p>
		<p>After Senate Bill 42 was enacted, this bill directed the Utah State Board of Education to implement policies and procedures for teaching of ASL in Utah’s public and high education system, and also mandated that a student “may count credit received for completion of a course in ASL toward the satisfaction of a foreign language requirement in the public education system under rules made by the State Board (Guerrero, UAD Bulletin, May 1994). The new ASL legislation sparked debate at Weber State University. The Senate Bill 42 mandated that ASL be accorded equal status with other linguistic systems in Utah’s public and high education systems, but at WSU, there had been debates and disagreements about the bill’s meaning and consequents impact at WSU. Dr. Robert Belka said the legislation did nothing to change the status of ASL at WSU and noted the section of the bill seemed to apply to public education only.</p>
		<p>Before Utah Senate Bill 42 was enacted, American Sign Language course was offered in local postsecondary institutes such as Brigham Young University, Weber State University, Utah State University, University of Utah, Utah Valley University, and Salt Lake Community College. It was not easy to accept ASL as foreign language requirements. Many people previously assumed ASL didn’t fit under the foreign language category because it was not a spoken language. Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz, a former ASL faculty at BYU stated, “Having ASL viewed as a language equal with the others helps in furthering the cultural and linguistic needs of our community” (UAD Bulletin, March 1991, p. 2).</p>
		<p>Senator Brent C. Richards, who sponsored the bill, was surprised that any public education institution would believe the bill will not have any effect to on them. He emphasized that, “Every institution of high education in Utah will absolutely be affected by this bill” (p. 3). Dr. Bill Vicars, WSU ASL instructor and ASL activist viewed the bill as a clear victory for the Deaf community and ASL proponents in Utah. He said, “When the legislation passed, there was a feeling of vindication that what we had been saying along was now being recognized – not just by linguists, but by members of the general community” (3). However, in the public educational system, the majority of sign language interpreters who learned ASL as a second language did not have fluent ASL skills to be able to effectively interpret on an academic level. Thus, deaf students placed in mainstream classrooms quickly fell behind and failed to receive an education equal to their hearing peers (Jeff Pollock, personal communication, May 3, 2006).</p>
		<p>Today, deaf people reclaim ASL as their birthright, a natural language that had been denied to them for over one hundred years. In January 2008, National Association of the Deaf affirmed its position that acquisition of language from birth is a human right for every person, and that deaf infants and children should be given the opportunity to acquire and develop proficiency in ASL as early as possible (American Sign Language: 2008 Position Statement).</p>

			<p>In 1994, the Utah Association for the Deaf protested against the Utah State Office of Education for its poor choice of setting up the USDB Task Force to determine education issues of the deaf by having 28 hearing persons and one deaf person (Dr. Robert G. Sanderson) on the Force. The Task Force did take notice and had agreed to recognize the culturally deaf as different from oral deaf and to include more deaf representation on the USDB Institutional Council, and in the future, will set up an education committee with more deaf representatives (Mortensen, UAD Bulletin, December 1994).</p>

		<h3>The Deaf Mentor Program</h3>
		<p>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, bilingual-bicultural (Bi-Bi) education for children who are deaf or hard of hearing was being discussed and examined across the United States. The precepts of this movement were focused primarily on school-aged children. The concept behind this educational approach was to expose children who were deaf or hard of hearing to ASL and English, and to use ASL to help teach English concepts, while also exposing children to both Deaf and Hearing cultures. Researchers and program developers from the SKI-HI Institute at Utah State University, Dr. Tom Clark, Dr. Sue Watkins, and Dr. Paula Pittman were intrigued with the concepts behind the Bi-Bi educational approach and wanted to explore providing a Bilingual-Bicultural approach to families who had young infants, toddlers, and children ages birth to five. In 1991 the SKI-HI Institute team wrote a grant to the Office of Special Education Programs to explore how to bring the Bi-Bi option to families when their children are very young. The grant was funded and in 1993 the SKI-HI Institute partnered with the Utah Deaf community and the Utah Schools for the Deaf and Blind to bring the Deaf Mentor Project to Utah (Dr. Paula Pittsman, personal communication, January 8, 2009).</p>
		<p>The primary goal of the SKI-HI Institute was to implement the Deaf Mentor Project and then to evaluate the effectiveness of that project to determine if families could, with the help of professionals, create a bilingual-bicultural environment in their homes where children were exposed to both conceptually accurate signed English and ASL, and where they and their children were involved in the both the Deaf and Hearing cultures. For the first time in the history of early childhood deaf education, the SKI-HI Institute was going to add a missing link to early intervention programming for families with deaf and hard-of-hearing infants and toddlers, Deaf Mentors. In addition to services from Parent-Infant Advisors and other professionals, families would benefit greatly from Deaf adult role models who would teach them American Sign Language, model appropriate visual communication and interaction with their deaf/hard-of-hearing infants and toddlers, and introduce the families to the Deaf community. All of these things would occur during weekly home visits. Every six months, infants and toddlers who are deaf or hard of hearing would be assessed for their language development, and at the end of the three-year grant project, parents would be interviewed regarding their satisfaction with the program. Parent’s perception of the Deaf community as well as their child's future as a child and an adult were also assessed before and after Deaf Mentor services began.</p>
		<p>The concept of the Deaf Mentor Project was created by Dr. Tom Clark, Dr. Sue Watkins, and Dr. Paula Pittman from the SKI-HI Institute, but the development of the project and the implementation of the project was a true partnership between the SKI-HI Institute, the Utah Deaf community, and the Parent Infant Program (PIP) at USDB. The Parent Infant Program, known as PIP, was established in 1973 through a model demonstration grant also designed by Dr. Tom Clark at the SKI-HI Institute. The program, originally called the SKI-HI Model Project, was designed to train professionals, called Parent Advisors, to go to the homes of families who had young children who are deaf or hard of hearing and provide them with support and information so they could more effectively raise their child. Since over 90% of children who are born deaf or hard of hearing are born to hearing parents, there is a great need for those parents to receive good, unbiased information about all of the decisions parents must make for their child. The original SKI-HI Model Program was adopted by the Utah Schools for the Deaf and Blind and was given the name the Parent Infant Program. It has been a strong program within the Utah Schools for the Deaf and Blind for over 30 years and remains an essential part of the services the school provides.</p>
		<p>When the Deaf Mentor Project was beginning, Dr. Robert Sanderson was involved in initial brainstorming meetings along with UAD Board members and SKI-HI staff in order to make this idea come to life. Initially SKI-HI staff members held information meetings with the Deaf community all along the Wasatch Front to let them know about the new program that was being developed. Individuals interested in becoming Deaf Mentors were asked to fill out applications during those meetings. Seventy-seven people initially applied to become Deaf Mentors. A committee of Deaf community members, including Dr. Sanderson, Darlene Cochran, Gene Stewart, and Dave Mortensen, reviewed all of the applicants and rated each according to a review scale to help the SKI-HI team narrow down those that would be included in initial interviews. Twenty-five individuals were interviewed to become the first Deaf Mentors in the country. Nine applicants were chosen and were trained to become our first Deaf Mentors including Darlene Cochran, Nanette Hix, Denise Ivory, Heather Kendrick, Marlene Malm, Kristi Mortensen, Rosa Maria Rathbun, Ricky Rose, and Paul Ruth.</p>
		<p>The Parent Infant Program at the Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind agreed to partner with the SKI-HI Institute so that information about the Deaf Mentor Project could be shared with families in the PIP program. Parent Advisors received training about the Deaf Mentor Project, as did the teachers at USDB. Families that were receiving PIP services were invited to public meetings to learn more about the Deaf Mentor Project. Initially twenty-six families within PIP were interested in receiving Deaf Mentor services once they began.</p>
		<p>In October, 1993, the newly hired Deaf Mentors attended an initial Deaf Mentor Training. This training workshop was conducted by Dr. Paula Pittman and Dr. Susan Watkins, with Jan King from USU as a speaker as well. Deaf Mentors were trained for three days to learn and comprehend the policies of the Deaf Mentor Experimental Research Project and the activities and responsibilities they would have in this project before they started working directly with families. “The experience was rich,” Deaf Mentors commented. Once initial training was completed and families volunteered to be a part of the Deaf Mentor Experimental Research Project, the Project was launched to provide weekly home visits to parents that provided ASL instruction, Early Visual communication, and Deaf culture to families of Deaf children from birth through age five. The Deaf Mentor Experimental Research Project provided guidance and information for parents of deaf children which included techniques and strategies to develop skills in the following areas:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>understanding and using ASL effectively</li>
			<li>understanding the deaf child's needs</li>
			<li>conversational interaction with children using early visual communication methods</li>
			<li>interactive activities with the child where families could learn how to use ASL successfully and in fun ways with their child</li>
			<li>involvement and understanding of the Deaf culture and Deaf community and an understanding of cultural behaviors within the Deaf community.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Deaf Mentors continued to receive ongoing training once a month under Dr. Paula Pittman, the director during the three-year grant project. Training workshops included topics on early language development, understanding and working with parents, how to work with children who are hyper-active, including siblings in home visits, techniques and activities to help families understand ASL concepts, working with children who have additional disabilities, and a wide variety of additional topics. Guest lecturers were invited to present new information to Deaf Mentors, including presenters from Canada who provided information on developing self esteem in young children, and presenters from Gallaudet who shared more about providing effective Bi-Bi education. Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz presented twice, giving Deaf Mentors more in-depth information on the structures of ASL. Deaf Mentors were also involved in the Deaf Connection and encouraged families to come to the Deaf center and be a part of Deaf community events.</p>
		<p>Deaf Mentors and Parent Advisors became great partners in providing services to families under the Parent Infant Program. While Deaf Mentors made weekly visits and Parent Advisors made their weekly visits at a different time, the two worked together as a team to provide families with the best services possible. Every three to four months Deaf Mentors and Parent Advisors were encouraged to make joint visits to families where the Deaf Mentor would communicate with the family using ASL and the Parent Advisor would communicate with the family using signed English. This proved to be a very fun and rewarding experience for everyone involved. Families loved these joint visits and had the opportunity to see ASL and signed English being used successfully with their child, and Deaf Mentors and Parent Advisors became true partners in providing good early intervention services to children who are deaf or hard of hearing.</p>
		<p>Many committed and passionate members of the Deaf and Hearing communities made the original Deaf Mentor Research Project a success. Dr. Petra Horn-Marsh (formerly Rose) was a diagnostician for the project and conducted language assessments on children from 1993 to 1996 until the grant was completed. Dr. Sanderson, David Mortensen, Darlene Cochran, and Rosa Maria Rathbun served as Advisory Board Members along with parents Martin and Kelli Illi and Gary and Renee Evans who have children who are deaf or hard of hearing who received Deaf Mentor services. Carol Croyle, a Parent Advisor in PIP began the Deaf Connection in partnership with the SKI-HI Institute so families and children could begin to gain exposure to the Deaf community in fun ways. Freeman and Jan King, professors at Utah State University, and Dr. Petra Marsh assisted Dr. Watkins and Dr. Pittman in developing the Deaf Mentor Curriculum. Dr. Paula Pittman, Dr. Sue Watkins, and Jan King were involved in initial training of the Deaf Mentors. In the first year of the Project, Minnie Mae Wilding-Diaz provided intense workshops for Deaf Mentors in ASL to strengthen the Mentor’s ability to comprehend the complex structures of the language and teach them to families. Minnie Mae also served on the interview committee for the selection of Deaf Mentors along with Kelli Illi, who at the time was the mother of three children who are deaf and one that was hearing. Of course, the Deaf Mentor Experimental Research Project could have never succeeded without the Deaf Mentors, the Parent Advisors in PIP, and all of the parents and families who were willing to be a part of the Project.</p>
		<p>This was a unique landmark project of monumental importance because it brought together Deaf and hearing professionals, hearing parents and Deaf adults, and a variety of different agencies. The three-year grant-funded Deaf Mentor Project was a huge success. The research conducted during the study revealed that children in the program developed better English skills than children who did not have Deaf Mentors, and of course, they also had developed amazing ASL skill. Children who received Deaf Mentor services and services from Parent Advisors were able to communicate more effectively with their families than those children who did not have Deaf Mentors in their homes. Families who had received Deaf Mentor services were determined to keep the program alive even after the grant funding for the Deaf Mentor Project ended in 1995.</p>
		<p>Parents who had received Deaf Mentor services and members of the Deaf community lobbied the legislature to provide ongoing funding for the Deaf Mentor Project. Nearly 200 Parents, children and Deaf community members came to the Utah State Capitol to support the passing of the funding for the Project. The funding was provided, and because of the program's amazing success, and deaf and hard-of-hearing children's huge language growth, in 1996, Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind agreed to accept the project under their umbrella and placed it with the Parent-Infant Program. At that time the Deaf Mentor Experimental Research Project became the Utah Deaf Mentor Program. It was a landmark project of monumental importance because it brought together the Deaf and hearing communities to create a better world for children who are deaf or hard of hearing and their families. Soon this experimental project would become a permanent part of Utah education.</p>
		<p>In 1995, the Deaf Mentor Project received the Presidential Award from Utah Association for the Deaf in recognition for the valuable contributions that this project has had and will have on the future empowerment of young deaf children. It was presented to Dr. Paula Pittman and the SKI-HI Institute.</p>
		<p>After the SKI HI at USU used up the three-year federal grant for the “Deaf Mentor” program, the 1996 Utah State Legislature approved the USDB budget to take up and continue the Deaf mentor Program under the Parent Infant Program (Mortensen, UAD Bulletin, February 1997). It was Dr. Paula Pittman who set the program up within the Parent Infant Program once it was transferred to the USDB Parent Infant Program. However, Dr. Pittman felt that the program should be run by a Deaf person who had experience with the original Deaf Mentor Project. It was agreed that a qualified deaf person be hired to become the first Deaf Mentor Specialist under PIP. Dr. Petra Horn-Marsh became the first Deaf Mentor Specialist, and the number of families grew from 34 to 76 in just four years. In addition, families became more comfortable with the Deaf community and aware of educational options for their deaf and hard-of-hearing children, making informed educational decisions for their children. Furthermore, many of these Deaf Mentor families played important leadership roles in the establishment of Jean Massieu School, a bilingual charter school of the deaf that was established in Salt Lake City.</p>
		<p>Drs. Marsh and Pittman added to the information and lessons that Deaf Mentors were providing to families through the Deaf Mentor Curriculum Manual by implementing the Shared Reading Project into Deaf Mentor Services. The Shared Reading Project (SRP) assists families in learning how to read stories effectively with their children who are deaf or hard of hearing. The Shared Reading Project (SRP) was developed by the Laurent Clerc National Deaf Education Center at Gallaudet University. The goals and outcomes of the Deaf Mentor Program blended so well with the concepts of the SRP, that the Deaf Mentors in Utah began implementing SRP lessons with the topics in the Deaf Mentor Curriculum, helping families to read to their children and improve their ASL and English language skills. SRP training was provided to trainers by Michelle Tanner, who is still the active SRP trainer for the state of Utah.</p>
		<p>The SKI-HI Institute wrote a new grant to take the successful Deaf Mentor Project on the road, giving other states the opportunity to establish Deaf Mentor Programs of their own. Darlene Cochran, Nanette Hix, Marlene Malm, and Rosa Maria Rathbun had the opportunity to participate as National Deaf Mentor Trainers with Dr. Paula Pittman for the Deaf Mentor Outreach Project at the SKI-HI Institute. This Project was directed by Dr. Pittman. These trainers traveled to nine states that were interested in Deaf Mentor Programming, trained their new Deaf Mentors, and helped them establish their own Deaf Mentor Programs. Their experience was wonderful, especially when meeting with people who were interested in assisting the families. Deaf Mentors that were met in other states were concerned about parents who did not know how to communicate or interact with their children. Deaf Mentors here and in other states witnessed the enormous growth in the families after they learned and accepted their children’s deafness and their identity and learned to communicate effectively with them.</p>
		<p>In 2000, Dr. Petra Horn-Marsh resigned as the Deaf Mentor Specialist. Barbara Bass, a long time USDB teacher and the last deaf teacher teaching on the Ogden campus, replaced Dr. Marsh as the Deaf Mentor Specialist. Barbara continued to follow the goals of the Deaf Mentor Program and kept the program strong for the two years that she led the Deaf Mentor Program. Upon Bass’ retirement in 2002, Terrance Cantrell assumed her position. He continued working as a Deaf Mentor Specialist until fall 2008.</p>
		<p>While employed as a Deaf Mentor Specialist, Cantrell organized and founded the Deaf Mentor Conference, which takes place annually in the fall. The Deaf Mentor Conference was designed to help families improve their ASL skills, gain knowledge of Deaf Culture, learn more about their Deaf child, and learn more about products and services available for them and their children. The other important goal of the Deaf Mentor Conference is for families to have opportunities to meet and talk with other families who are in similar situations. He believed that family and community involvement was necessary for all Deaf children and families to succeed in achieving the ultimate goal of language development in a bilingual-bicultural program. The Deaf Mentor Conference helped to meet this goal. By incorporating games, stories, information, and personal dialogue, families learned about hearing loss, communication methods, and gained a broader understanding of what life is like for the person who is deaf or hard of hearing.</p>
		<p>Over the years, many wonderful Deaf Mentors have worked for the Deaf Mentor Experimental Research Project and the Deaf Mentor Program based at USDB. While every single Deaf Mentor has brought so much to the Program, we would be remiss if we did not honor those who served with great dedication for the longest period of time. Darlene Cochran, who began as a member of the review committee long before anyone was hired as a Deaf Mentor and also served the program as an Advisory Board Member and became a National Trainer for the Deaf Mentor Outreach Project served as a Deaf Mentor for the Utah Program for 15 years, serving from the very beginning of the project until her retirement in 2006. Darlene is a gem and was extremely instrumental in the success of this program. Merilee Swain has served as a Deaf Mentor for 11 years and is still employed as a Deaf Mentor. Merilee is a Lead Deaf Mentor for the Deaf Mentor Program and is one of our key players as we look at new and exciting ways we can serve families and children in the program. Marlene Malm and Nanette Hix, both original Deaf Mentors, each served as Deaf Mentors in the Program for 10 years, and both were National Trainers for the Deaf Mentor Outreach Program at SKI-HI. The commitment and dedication of Deaf Mentors like these has been the backbone of this program for years.</p>
		<p>In recent years the Deaf Mentor Program has experienced some struggles. However, families are still very interested in services and the Parent Infant Program and USDB are investing time, energy and money into making this program strong and effective. A new Deaf Mentor Specialist, Emily (Broadbent) Tanner, was hired in January, 2009, to lead the Deaf Mentor Program into a new era. Dr. Pittman will work alongside Emily and the current Deaf Mentors in the program for a few months to make the program better than it has ever been. Emily has wonderful ideas for the program and has already made amazing changes. There is an excitement as this program begins to meet the needs of the 83 families in PIP who are interested in Deaf Mentor services. The future looks bright for the Deaf Mentor Program (Dr. Paula Pittsman, personal communication, January 8, 2009).</p>

			<p>Petra Horn, 35, was the first totally deaf woman to receive a PhD in sociology at Utah State University’s graduate commencement exercises on May 5, 2000. In fact, she may well be the first person in the United States to accomplish this goal, according to one of Petra’s greatest admires, Anne Butler, a history professor with a reputation for professional excellence (Brunson, UAD Bulletin, June 2000).</p>

			<p>Emily Broadbent Tanner, a Total Communication student in a public school system, quoted in the Ogden Standard Examiner on May 22, 1997 that “A lot of people think deaf people can’t do anything like we’re disabled or handicapped. We’re not. We have unique culture. We are a minority group, with our beliefs, culture and behaviors. Deaf people are normal, just like everybody else. They just can’t hear. That’s all” (Wangsgard, UAD Bulletin, July 1997).</p>

		<h3>Deaf and Hard of Hearing Child’s Bill of Rights</h3>
		<p>In 1992, the Council of Organizational Representatives provided a Deaf Child’s Bill of Rights in its testimony to Congress and requested that this Bill of Rights be incorporated in the Education of the Deaf Act. This Bill of Rights was not incorporated in the EDA, but was copied in State legislation (A Synopsis of the Bill of Rights for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children, 1997. Due to the lack of full communication/language accessibility and the deficiency of a full range of educational options system, Dave Mortensen, president of the Utah Association for the Deaf learned that the workshop that will be lead by two deaf individuals, Dr. Jay Innes, Deaf Education expert from the National Association of the Deaf at the California School for the Deaf, Fremont in California was also available to any group that is interested in spearheading a Deaf Child’s Bill of Rights in their home state. Dave immediately summoned Bronwyn O’Hara, a hearing parent of three deaf children, Stanley O’Neal, UAD Board Member, Kristi L. Mortensen, Deaf Education Advocate, Janice Gillespie, a Deaf representative, and Kenneth L. Kinner, a parent to Fremont, California for weekend training on the Deaf Child’s Bill of Rights and learned strategies on pushing a Deaf Child’s Bill of Right though the state legislature and implementing it into the law (UAD Bulletin, July 1995). Afterwards, the group tried their best to get the Deaf Child’s Bill of Rights off the ground but had a rocky start. Kristi Mortensen believed it is due to Utah’s “habits die hard” attitude of not willing to accept changes (Kristi Mortensen, personal communication, 2005). Kristi Mortensen, Chair of UAD Education Committee worked with a committee to develop a Utah Deaf Child’s Bill of Rights that would mandate by law to:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Provide full, equal communication and language access</li>
				<li>Provide a full range of educational alternative placement options</li>
				<li>Administer appropriate assessment of deaf and hard of hearing children</li>
				<li>Provide an education with a sufficient number of same language mode peers who are of the same age and ability level</li>
				<li>Provide opportunities to interact with deaf and hard of hearing adult role models</li>
				<li>Provide equal benefit from all services and programs at their schools</li>
				<li>Provide availability of qualified and certified personnel who can communicate directly with deaf and hard of hearing children</li>
				<li>Proclaims the child’s right to equal access to an appropriate education.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>After hard work developing the Deaf Child’s Bill of Rights, Utah became one of the few states that proposed the bill during the legislative session in 1996. However, both Utah School for the Deaf and Public Education were largely opposed to the Deaf Child’s Bill of Rights because of the funding reasons and the influence of strong oral tradition. In addition, they, including the Legislative Coalition for People with Disabilities felt this bill was not needed because of IDEA already being enacted.</p>
			<p>However, the IDEA, at this time, had no language or communication considerations emphasized. They also felt that the bill was not needed because in their view, they had already provided an appropriate education for deaf and hard of hearing children. Thus, the opposition of this bill persuaded legislators to take no action so the bill was on back burner. Kristi Mortensen “carried the torch” for some time in spite of her frustration with the establishment (Dr. Robert G. Sanderson, personal communication, May 16, 2007). After the legislative incident, Superintendent Lee Robinson (1994-2005) immediately created a Deaf Children’s Bill of Rights document with a list of educational services that deaf children have the right to access, when in fact, almost none of them were provided (Kristi Mortensen, personal communication, 2005).</p>
			<p>In February 1997, several other groups felt they should participant in the DCBR bill and have a voice in it. Hence, the UAD Education Committee decided not to introduce the bill to the 1997 Utah Legislature. Kristi and the Board members agreed that they would wait until they had given the other groups an opportunity to review the DBR and hold discussions (Mortensen, UAD Bulletin, February 1997). Helen Post, president of the Utah Parent Center and parent of deaf daughter, Anne Fife, was one of the people who stopped the Deaf Child’s Bill of Right after UAD spent many hours on the bill. While UAD challenged her why she stopped the bill at the board meeting, she emphasized that the Deaf community cannot do all that needs to be done alone. She, as a parent cannot do all that needs to be done alone. The Utah State Board of Education and the Utah State Office of Education cannot do it alone. The legislature cannot do anything that will be effective in helping all of them if they are working together. Helen believed that they can work together to do great things, (Post, UAD Bulletin, February 1997). Kristi acknowledged that it was important to get the full support from various groups as well as communities. Otherwise, the DCBR may not survive the legislature session (Mortensen, UAD Bulletin, February 1997).</p>
			<p>The next month on March 15, 1997, the Utah Association for the Deaf held a Deaf Child’s Bill of Rights Conference. The presenters were Leon Curtis, Utahn native and representative from the National Association for the Deaf, Region IV and Jay Innes, Chair of Deaf Education for the National Association of the Deaf (Nelson, UAD Bulletin, March 1997). Those presenters focused on understanding how the Bill of Rights would benefit deaf and hard of hearing children in schools under Utah School for the Deaf and Public Education. In the fall of 1997, Jay Innes asked that the DBCR bill to be on hold as Kristi’s current DCBR bill has several possible contradictions with the new IDEA 1997 and can create problems if they push it in the 1998 Legislative Session (Mortensen, UAD Bulletin, October, 1997). Kristi and UAD agreed to put it on hold.</p>
			<p>In 2004, Mortensen told the Utah Association of the Deaf board members that the “Deaf Child’s Bill of Rights” needed to be changed to “Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children’s Bill of Rights” in order to provide services to children with a full range of hearing loss. It seemed to be received favorably. There are many parents of deaf children who favored the new name and the awareness of the new name spread rapidly among these parents. Mortensen was certain that sooner than later Utah will have its own Deaf and Hard of Hearing Child’s Bill of Rights in state law (Kristi L. Mortensen, personal communication, 2005).</p>
			<p>Dr. Jay Innes, then Director of Gallaudet Leadership Institute, returned to Utah to present a Deaf and Hard of Hearing Child’s Bill of Rights on January 13, 2006 to present an overview of Deaf Education in the United States and in Utah as well. The issues he presented were discussed across the nation:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>More language-communication impact</li>
				<li>More accessibility to deaf and hard of hearing children with free flow interaction among peers regardless if they are deaf or hearing; and					</li>
				<li>More certified teachers in the Deaf education specialist area that know and understand the needs to provide a comfort zone environment for the deaf and hard of hearing children.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Dr. Innes emphasized the importance of getting a Bill of Rights passed in Utah because Federal laws did not have teeth strong enough for Utah’s deaf and hard of hearing children to get what they needed. He also provided more clarification on why Utah needed to implement the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Child’s Bill of Rights. The bill did not stress the communication philosophy, as it only stressed accessibility to everything that a deaf and hard of hearing child needs. The BCBR can help parents to know exactly if the placement of their deaf or hard of hearing child is appropriate and the IEP team will know how to serve the families appropriately (Mortensen, UAD Bulletin, February 2006).</p>
			<p>Kristi observed that for a long time, the IEP teams had been focusing on placement based on the ability of a deaf and hard of hearing child’s ability to hear and talk. She noticed that it was not working. Many studies had already indicted huge pitfalls when the children’s placement was done in error, and finds that when they reach adulthood, they spend a lot of time with Mental Health counselors. Many will end up getting Social Security Income due to a lack of getting the right education or perhaps communication skills were not developed as they grew (Mortensen, UAD Bulletin, February 2006). Kristi (2006) stated that, “We already know that it is very difficult for a full-grown adult to acquire new learning in a short time as compared to being very young and being in a language-communication educational environment, where they experience no obstacles in communication and learning” (p. 4). However, problems arose because the Utah Schools for the Deaf did not accept the new changes. It was viewed as a threat. Little they realized that the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Child’s Bill of Rights would influence education in every school system as a whole, not just in the Utah Schools for the Deaf (Kristi Mortensen, personal communication, 2006).</p>
			<p>Kristi firmly believed that parents of deaf and hard of hearing children were more receptive to the bill in positive ways. She noticed more and more hearing parents becoming proactive of their deaf children’s rights to full access to appropriate education, social skills, and communication skills, positive emotional and cognitive development (Kristi L. Mortensen, 2007).</p>
			<p>On April 30, 2009, Governor Jon Huntsman, Jr. signed HB296 into law where Utah Schools for the Deaf and the Blind will allow deaf students to stay in their school regardless of age or if parents want to keep their deaf child with USDB and not send the deaf child to a neighborhood school, due to access to full language, communication, and social skills. This is good news for the future and increases the possibility for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Child’s Bill of Rights to go through the halls of legislators and senators with favorable support. It will take a true village to roll up our sleeves and put the work into full speed.</p>
