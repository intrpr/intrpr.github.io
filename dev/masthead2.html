Please no phone calls.)</h6>				<h3>Required Texts</h3>				<p>Please bring your text, handouts, and notetaking materials to class each day.</p>				<ul>					<li><span class="hilite">*(Required) </span>Stewart, D.A., Schein, J.D., Cartwright, B.E. (2004). <em>Sign Language Interpreting: Exploring Its Art and Science, 2nd ed. New York: Allyn &amp; Bacon</em>. Readings and test materials will be taken primarily from this volume. (<a href="schedule.html">Chapter 1 is temporarily available at the class web site</a>.)</li>					<li><span class="hilite">Student handouts</span> containing resources, class assignments, and instructor-selected supplemental readings. <a href="index.html">Available at the class web site</a> and/or passed out in class, these may be distributed on an infrequent basis. These handouts are important; test materials will also come from these resources.</li>				</ul>					<h6>*Available in the UVSC bookstore or on the Internet at a variety of online bookstores and resellers.</h6>					<h3>How is my work evaluated? (or, in other words, &quot;How do I get an A?&quot;)</h3>					<p>Course final grades are determined by combining both (1) scores on all of the submitted assignments and exams and (2) in-class participation. More importantly, you should remember that making decisions in interpreting situations or producing interpreting work is about identifying and then applying knowledge to resolve communication differences.</p>					<p>While some portions of your coursework and exams will test for specific information, far less important is your ability to regurgitate facts and figures. Instead, assignments and exams are designed to identify how well you internalize principles, cultural and technical knowledge, and process understanding and then apply them to create solutions to various situations.</p>					<p>Scoring criteria are clearly defined on assignment handouts or exams; youâ€™ll know what you need to do to earn the grade you want. Ultimately, your grade is a reflection of personal effort and internalization of concepts learned in the course.</p>				<h3>Grading Breakdown</h3>				<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6">						<tr>							<td>A 100&#8211;93</td>							<td>B+ 89&#8211;87</td>							<td>C+ 79&#8211;77</td>							<td>D+ 69&#8211;67</td>							<td>E  59&#8211;0</td>						</tr>						<tr>							<td>A- 92&#8211;90</td>							<td>B  86&#8211;83</td>							<td>C  76&#8211;73</td>							<td>D  66&#8211;63</td>							<td></td>						</tr>						<tr>							<td></td>							<td>B- 82&#8211;80</td>							<td>C- 72&#8211;70</td>							<td>D- 62&#8211;60</td>							<td></td>						</tr>				</table>						<h3>College Policies and Students with Disabilities</h3>					<ul>						<li>College policy prohibits children in the classroom or children unattended in the halls. Make whatever arrangements you must in order to comply with this policy.</li>						<li>Failure to come to class does not constitute withdrawal from the course. If circumstances make it impossible for you to complete this course, then you must officially withdraw. Otherwise, you may receive a grade at the end of the semester you did not intend.</li>						<li>If you have any disability which may impair your ability to successfully complete this course, please contact the <a href="http://www.uvsc.edu/asd/">Accessibility Services Department</a> (BU-145). Academic accommodations are granted for all students who have qualified documented disabilities. Services are coordinated with the student and instructor by the Accessibility Services Department.</li>				</ul>						</div>			<div class="rightcol">				<h3>Course Requirements and Expectations</h3>				<p>These are my expectations of you:</p>					<ol>						<li><span class="firstline">There is a strict NO-VOICE policy in and around this class.</span> Each violation of this policy will result in a .5% deduction from your final grade. However, due to the nature of this course, if discussions are conducted in spoken English, you may be permitted to use voice (being sensitive to Deaf students). Understand, though, that voice/spoken English discussions are instituted at the discretion of the instructor. Please respect the importance of maintaining this policy.</li>						<li>Despite the diversity of our class, it is important that we strive to <span class="firstline">form a community of openness, collegiality, and trust</span>. Our cohesiveness influences how rich the language and idea exchange is in the classroom. Missing class makes it difficult to achieve this interactive environment.</li>						<li>This is a junior-level class; as such, it is assumed that <span class="firstline">you can maintain a certain level of self-mastery, scholastic discipline, and responsibility</span>. The attitude and success of this course is dependant on your preparation and interactivity. <span class="hilite">Please come to class on time&#8212;not five to ten minutes late&#8212;and be prepared.</span> You should read and study the appropriate unit in the text for each class period (see class schedule), turn in the outline, and be prepared not only to answer questions, but also to ask them. Being ill-prepared sets the class back and undermines our classroom community.</li>						<li><span class="firstline">Academic Integrity.</span> Your assignments and classwork are graded on an honor system; completing classwork indicates that you have studied and made a serious attempt to complete an assignment. <span class="hilite">Note: cheating, plagiarism, or any dishonest work violates this honor system as well as UVSC policy will result in the automatic failure of the assignment and/or the course.</span> Further punishment(s) for cheating will also be given by college administrators.</li>						<li><span class="firstline">Class attendance is important and necessary.</span> Because this class is only held for 75 minutes twice a week, it is, of necessity, faster-paced. When you miss a class, you are responsible for all materials presented, i.e. lecture notes, changes in class schedule, and assignments. If you will be absent when an assignment is due, I urge you to 1) bring the assignment to me early to avoid late penalties, 2) give the assignment to a classmate for submission, or 3) electronically submit the assignment. (Electronic submissions are acceptable only at the approval of the instructor and are subject to timely reception of the assignment.)</li>					</ol>				<p>This is what you may expect of me:</p>					<ul>						<li><span class="firstline">The instructor will be fair.</span> There are no preconceived notions about the skills, abilities, and knowledge that students individually bring into the class community. Indeed, grades are given based on personal progress up (or down) one's own scale.</li>						<li><span class="firstline">The instructor will evaluate each student on his or her own merits. </span>As such, grades on curves or comparisons to other students are counterproductive and set false standards. If you earned an 85, you will receive an 85, not someone else's interpretation of an 85.</li>						<li><span class="firstline">The instructor will treat students with respect.</span> Just as it is demanded of you, so too, you have the right to demand this of the instructor. Belittling, faultfinding, or demeaning student's thoughts and feelings is inappropriate.</li>						<li><span class="firstline">The instructor will provide honest evaluations and assessments.</span> Interpreting is a emotionally demanding (and sometimes draining) profession; developing a thick skin is a recommended goal at this stage in your training. In the spirit of respectful treatment, this also means that evaluations and/or offline discussions of inaccurate, inequivalent, or substandard performance will not receive an ego stroking or &quot;pat on the back.&quot; In essence, there is a reason why you are the student and the instructor is the instructor. These are opportunities to receive mentored, unbiased, and professional evaluations of your work.</li>				    </ul>			</div>		<div style="clear: both;"></div>		<div class="footer">			<div class="footerleft">				<h6><img src="img/uvscds2.gif" alt="uvsc asl/ds" width="72" height="60" align="left" style="margin: 0 1.5em 0 0;" />Doug Stringham<br />					<a href="http://uvsc.edu/asl/">Department of ASL and Deaf Studies</a><br />					<a href="http://uvsc.edu/">Utah Valley State College, Orem, Utah</a><br />				</h6>			</div>			<div class="footerright">				<h6>The material on the pages of this Web site is solely for the benefit of the students enrolled in this course.
