	<h2>About This Site</h2>
	
	<!-- Left Column; replace when column-break-before is implemented in CSS3 !-->
	<div class="leftcol">
		<h3>What&#8217;s going on here?</h3>
		<p>This site is (or was?) intended to make my life simpler as an instructor. Let&#8217;s face it: school is difficult. It takes up an inordinate amount of time, and, while it is worth it in the long run, a wee bit of organization certainly helps the cause.</p>
		<p>This site is also an experiment in simplicity. Users hate to be frustrated when they use websites, so I&#8217;ve tried to make every contingency that I could think of. I&#8217;m sure you, gentle reader, will find areas that can be improved and so I invite your feedback.</p>
		<p>This entire site is standards-compliant; (for you gearheads) it is developed responsively in <abbr>HTML5</abbr>, <abbr>CSS3</abbr>, and is <abbr>W3C</abbr> and <abbr>508</abbr> compliant. Within the body of the site, there is not one&#8212;no, not one&#8212;tdbody, colspan, or Microsoft FrontPage line of code included. Thanks to the beauty of cascading style sheets, everything you see before you is text-based.</p>
		<p>For those of you with iPhones, Android OS, and iPads, this will display nicely on your devices as well. Go ahead and view in on your desktop. Now resize your browser window or try your iPhone. Neat-o, eh?</p>
		<p>All downloadable files&#8212;class notes, syllabi, and other handouts&#8212;are saved in <span class="smallcaps">PDF</span> formats and require <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">Adobe Acrobat Reader</a>. If the computer you are using does not have Acrobat or the Acrobat browser plugin, you can download the free Reader application.</p>
		<h3>About UVU&#8217;s Courses</h3>
		<p>Let&#8217;s take this opportunity to clear up some myths:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><span class="smallcaps">UVU</span> has not, does not, nor does it plan to establish a full-blown interpreting training program, per se. There. It&#8217;s said. You can check with my boss on this one, but I&#8217;m pretty sure he&#8217;ll back me up.</li>
			<li>As of the end of Fall Semester 2010, the <span class="smallcaps">ACIPP</span> program has been discontinued. Please contact the Foreign Language office or Dr. Eldredge for more information about future <span class="smallcaps">UVU</span> interpreting paracertificate programs. <s><span class="smallcaps">UVU</span> does offer, however, an independently-funded <a href="http://www.uvu.edu/lang/programs/asl/interpreting.html">Advanced Certification Interpreter Preparation Program (<span class="smallcaps">ACIPP</span>)</a> to interpreters looking for a highly-focused academic track to help them obtain advanced state or national interpreter certification. Read more about it at their website.</s></li>
			<li>As of Fall 2004, <span class="smallcaps">UVU</span> offers a <a href="http://uvsc.edu/asl/programsanddegrees/degree.html">minor in ASL and Deaf Studies</a>.</li>
			<li>And as of Fall 2007, <span class="smallcaps">UVU</span> now offers a <a href="http://uvsc.edu/asl/programsanddegrees/degree.html">bachelor&#8217;s degree in ASL and Deaf Studies</a>. That&#8217;s fairly exciting, seeing that there are literally a handful of such programs offered in the United States and you get to come all the way to Utah to get your degree.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><a href="http://www.uvu.edu/catalog/2009-2010/pdfversion/course_descriptions/ASL_American_Sign_Language.pdf">Read</a> the class descriptions at the department ASL website or if you&#8217;re interested in learning how these courses are applied towards your degree, contact ASL Department Chair, Bryan Eldredge, eldredbr (at) uvu.edu or 863-8529.</p>

		<h3>Contact Information</h3>
		<p>If you need to contact me, the best way is via email. My kids may answer the phone (trust me, you don&#8217;t want that) and my wife doesn&#8217;t appreciate getting calls at home. (If you absolutely must use the phone, you may call my mobile phone&#8212;ask me for the number first.) So email me at <span class="hilite">dstringham (at) gmail.com</span>. Rest assured, I&#8217;m very responsive to e-mail so I&#8217;ll get your information one way or the other.</p>
		<p>You can also schedule appointments with me on campus either before/after class.</p>
		<p>And I suppose if you really don&#8217;t want to talk to me, you could bother my department head: Dr. Bryan Eldredge, eldredbr (at) uvu.edu, LA003j; (801) 863-8529 V/VP.</p>
		<h3>Colophon</h3>
		<p>While this site is optimally viewed in Mac <span class="smallcaps">OS X </span>(let&#8217;s face it, what web site isn&#8217;t?), because it is run via cascading style sheets, it also works reasonably well with all current Mozilla builds.</p>
