Exams are given only on the pre-assigned day. Except for extremely rare instances, make-up exams will not be given. Giving make-up exams is unfair to those students who have made the effort to complete the exam on time.</p>				<p>Work schedules, out-of-town trips, or dating habits are not valid excuses for missing exams. If you must miss an exam, please see me before the exam day to discuss your conflict. Final exams cannot be given early or on any other date than what is proscribed by the College. So don’t even ask.</p>				<h3>Assignment Breakdown</h3>					<table cellspacing="0" width="100%">							<tr>								<td>Chapter Outlines</td>								<td>88 points<br />(8 outlines; 11 pts. each)</td>							</tr>							<tr>								<td>Annotated Bibliographies</td>								<td>225 points<br />(3 bibliographies; 75 pts. each)</td>							</tr>							<tr>								<td>Exams</td>								<td>300 points<br />(3 exams; 100 pts. each)</td>							</tr>							<tr>								<td>Final Exam</td>								<td>130 points</td>							</tr>							<tr>								<td>Extra Credit*</td>								<td>(as requested; ask the instructor)</td>							</tr>						<tr>							<td><strong>Total**</strong></td>								<td><strong>743 points</strong></td>						</tr>				</table>						<h6>&nbsp;</h6>				<h6>*Extra credit may be given for special projects completed throughout the semester.

Chapter outlines. To help you internalize concepts in the text, you'll be required to compile outlines on chapters 1-11 in the text. These basic yet fairly comprehensive outlines:</p>					<ul>						<li>encourage your readings in the text</li>						<li>help you highlight specific areas of question for in-class discussions and exam preparation</li>					</ul>					<p>Outlines are due at the beginning of the first class of a new chapter (<a href="#">see class schedule for due dates</a>). Completion of an outline indicates that you have studied the chapter; if you haven't, don't turn in an outline. Faked and rushed outlines are easily spotted and greatly undermine the class's trust. Late outlines will not be accepted.</p>					<p>2. Annotated Bibliographies. In order to keep current on issues facing the interpreting field, you’ll be required to compile a series of references and resources in connection with an assigned topic. Bibliographies are due at the beginning of class (<a href="#">see class schedule for due dates</a>). Again, turning in a bibliography indicates that you have actually performed research. If you haven’t done this, don’t turn in a bibliography. Faked work is easily identified, and will result in a failing grade on the assignment. Late bibliographies will be penalized at 10% per day (not class period). See class handouts for requirements and specifications.</p>				<p>3. Exams. There will be three exams during the semester, and one final exam. Each exam will be a written exam, designed to assess your knowledge of concepts discussed in lectures, readings, and handouts. <a href="#">See class schedule for dates</a>.</p>			</div>		<div style="clear: both;"></div>		<div class="footer">			<div style="width: 18.5em; padding: 0; float: left;">				<h6><img src="uvscds2.gif" alt="uvsc asl/ds" width="72" height="60" align="left" style="margin: 0 1.5em 0 0;" />Doug Stringham<br />					<a href="http://uvsc.edu/asl/">Department of ASL and Deaf Studies</a><br />					<a href="http://uvsc.edu/">Utah Valley State College, Orem, Utah</a><br />				</h6>			</div>			<div style="width: 29.5em; padding: 0 0 0 1em; float: left;">				<h6>The material on the pages of this Web site is solely for the benefit of the students enrolled in this course.
