				<h3>How does this class fit into the rest of the interpreting classes here at UVU?</h3>
				<p>ASL3350 is named Consecutive Interpreting, focusing on an introduction to bidirectional (ASL-to-English and English-to-ASL) consecutive interpreting theory and practice between Deaf and nondeaf people. (If you were enrolled at <span class="smallcaps">UVSC</span> (Utah Valley State College) prior to the Fall 03 semester, ASL3350 was previously titled ASL4320.) Here&#8217;s where it currently fits into the program (this list is not comprehensive):</p>

				<p>In addition, since 2006, <span class="smallcaps">UVU</span> has offered an independently-funded Advanced Certification Interpreter Preparation Program (<span class="smallcaps">ACIPP</span>) which focuses on currently-certified interpreters looking for an academic track to help them obtain advanced state or national interpreter certification. If you&#8217;re interested in the <span class="smallcaps">ACIPP</span>, <a href="http://www.uvsc.edu/asl/interpreting/acipp.html">you can learn more about it here</a>.</p>

				<h3>When does class meet?</h3>
				<p>Class time and period are MW 6:30&#8211;7:45 pm in LA233. <a href="syllabus.html">Read the syllabus</a> for more information.</p>
				<h3>How can I contact the instructor?</h3>
				<p>The best way to contact me is via e-mail. <a href="contact.html">Go to the contact page</a> for more information.</p>
				<h3>How do I get a good grade in this class?</h3>
				<p>Course final grades are determined by combining both (1) scores on all of the <a href="assignments.html">submitted assignments and exams</a> and (2) considering assessed performance on your <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dEFvQW81b0NCSjNsb19aOUh6NXJ6REE6MA..">student-teacher contract</a>. More importantly, you should remember that making decisions in interpreting situations or producing interpreting work <span class="hilite">is <em>really</em> all about efficient and fluent problem solving</span>: identifying and then applying knowledge to resolve communication differences. </p>
				<p>While some portions of your coursework and quizzes will test for specific factual information (<em>remembering</em> skills), far less important is your ability to regurgitate facts and figures. Instead, <a href="assignments.html">assignments, labs, and the final exam</a> are designed to identify how well you internalize principles, cultural and technical knowledge, and process understanding, and then apply them to create solutions to various situations (<em>applying</em> and <em>analyzing</em><em> </em>skills).</p>

					<li><span class="hilite">Want to learn more about higher-level learning?</span> Try <a href="http://projects.coe.uga.edu/epltt/index.php?title=Bloom%27s_Taxonomy">Bloom&#8217;s (revised) Taxonomy</a> or <a href="http://www.christina.k12.de.us/techlearn/tools/Bloom%27sTaxonomy.htm">this list of action verbs based on Bloom&#8217;s</a>. Skills higher up on the pyramid are necessary for equivalent interpreting; our class assignments and exams will require you to demonstrate performance on several levels.</li>

				</ul>
				<p><a href="assignments.html">Scoring criteria</a> are clearly defined on assignment handouts or exams; youâ€™ll know what you need to do to <a href="syllabus.html">earn the grade you want</a>. Ultimately, your grade is a reflection of personal effort and internalization of concepts learned in the course.</p>
				<h3>When are assignments due? When is the final? What&#8217;s on the quizzes? The exams?</h3>
				<p>All schedule-related questions can be answered on the <a href="schedule.html">class schedule</a>. Final exams cannot be given early or on any other date than what is proscribed by the college. Please don&#8217;t ask. All quizzes will consist of questions designed to test your knowledge of class lectures and important information found in the text and handouts; the final exam is a performance (interpreted) assessment. <a href="assignments.html">Read more on the assignments page</a>.</p>
				<h3>Do you have any class notes or handouts on this site?</h3>
				<p>Most of the information in the teacher&#8217;s presentations and lecture outline is found in your text. Sometimes, specific class notes or charts may be distributed on an infrequent basis. These handouts are important; exam and discussion materials will also come from these resources. All of the class handouts and some lecture materials <a href="schedule.html">can be found on the schedule</a>.</p>
