				<h3>About This Course</h3>
				<h2>This course is an introduction to <span class="hilite">consecutive sign language interpreting theory and practice</span> between Deaf and nondeaf people. Upon successful completion of this course, students will demonstrate they can:</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>describe and evaluate the academic and theoretical contributions of significant educators and practitioners in the interpreting field (Cokely, Colonomos, Patrie, Witter-Merrithew, Taylor, et al.), including a practical application of non-judgemental language</li>
					<li>identify and incorporate a best-practice taxonomy of competencies and processes required to produce consecutive interpretations</li>
					<li>demonstrate and self-monitor basic abilities required to create consecutive interpretations of rehearsed and/or spontaneous texts:
						<ul>
							<li>increase competent usage of source language (sL) and target language (tL) (Cokely) </li>
							<li>recognize a typology of interpretation miscues (Cokely, Gonzalez) and monitor their manifestation in interpretations</li>
							<li>describe and apply the cognitive tasks of pegging, chunking, linking, and monitoring to understand a discourse</li>
							<li>organize and map (Witter-Merrithew, Monkowski &amp; Winston) both distinctive and discrete units of information for an interpretation</li>
							<li>reformulate both abstract and concrete message parts (Patrie, Colonomos) of a discourse into a consecutive interpretation</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>identify impacts on and incorporation of semantic choice, register, and ethical behavioral decisions in consecutive interpretations</li>
				</ol>
				<p>A significant portion of this course requires self-directed efforts (asychronously working with other teammates) and fairly good command of web-based technologies and learning environments (v/blog creation and maintenance, video creation, salient discussion and reporting skills; we&#8217;ll discuss this more in class).</p>
				<p><strong>This course will requires a one-hour per week lab criteria</strong>; expect to spend at least an hour a week on skill building exercises in a language laboratory setting.</p>
