				<h3>Due Dates and Missing Exams/Classes</h3>
				<p>Please adhere to all due dates on your class schedule. Exams are given only on the pre-assigned day. Except for extremely exceptional instances, a make-up exam will not be available. Giving a make-up exam is unfair to those students who have made the effort to complete the exam on time.</p>
				<p>Work schedules, out-of-town trips, or dating habits are not valid excuses for missing exams. If you must miss an assignment, please see me <span class="hilite"><em>before the exam day</em></span> to discuss your conflict. Final exams cannot be given early or on any other date than what is proscribed by the College. Please donâ€™t  ask.</p>
				<h3>Assignment Breakdown</h3>
				<p>You may also want to <a href="writing.html">look at what kind of performance is expected</a> on submitted postings, evaluations, and, to a certain extent (at least principally), your lab assignments.</p>

				<h3>Semester Assignments</h3>
				<ol>
					<li><span class="firstline">Student-teacher contract.</span> Determine the parameters of a contract between you and the instructor that will help determine the evaluation and measurement of your in-class performance this semester. What grade do you want? Why? Thoughtfully include what requirements, stipulations, and conditions you&#8217;ll need to satisfy in order to warrant the grade you want to earn from this class. Additionally, explain what you feel the instructor can do/should do to enable your best performance. See the <a href="schedule.html">class schedule</a>; this contract is worth ten points. <span class="hilite">Late submissions will not be accepted.</span></li>
					<li><span class="firstline">In-class participation, presentations, and producing interpreting work.</span> Interpreting necessitates 1) feeling comfortable in front of a group and 2) creating equivalent renderings of topics. Participation in in-class interpreting assignments, exercises, and feedback sessions is, needless to say, <em>mandatory</em>. See <a href="schedule.html">class schedule</a> for assignments.</li>
					<li><span class="firstline">Blog Postings and Peer Evaluations.</span> You&#8217;ll be blogging and commenting this semester...and getting credit for it. Understand that this type of expression is a means to an end; you&#8217;ve got some specific topics and readings about which to write:
						<ul>
							<li>At the very least, you&#8217;ll be required to 1) <span class="hilite">submit</span> salient (read: thought-out and reasoned college level writing and thinking) <span class="hilite">posts about assigned discussion topics and readings</span> and 2) <span class="hilite">make comments on other students&#8217; posts and thoughts</span>. </li>
							<li>At best, you should endeavor to continue the threads you start, and <span class="hilite">really engage your fellow students</span> (think your fellow interpreting peers and colleagues) in a discourse about these topics.</li>
							<li>Additionally, you&#8217;re encouraged to use <a href="http://www.schoology.com/course/331791">your blog as a journal to capture ideas, thoughts, and multimedia</a> about interpreting practice and theory.</li>
						</ul>
					<a href="writing.html">You&#8217;ll want to understand more about the criteria for the depth and breadth of your postings</a>. Additionally, all writing assignments are identified on the <a href="schedule.html">class schedule</a> in <span class="due"><strong>blue</strong></span>. Please use these assignments as a great opportunity to receive mentored, peer, and professional evaluations of your work.
					<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
					As a reminder, submitting a post indicates that you have actually read and put forth a little effort; faked work is easily identified, and will result in a reduced or failing grade on the assignment. <span class="hilite">Late postings will be penalized at 10% <em>per day</em> (not class period).</span> Feel free to ask the instructor for direction at any time.</li>
					<li><span class="firstline">Labs and exercises.</span> This is a 3:3:1 course; in other words, you get three credits in exchange for three weekly hours of coursework and one hour of lab work. Our text, Patrie&#8217;s <em>Effective Interpreting Series</em> is formatted as a workbook, perfect for capturing language lab self- and dyad-paced efforts.
					<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
					From time to time, we may spend time in class working on one of a unit&#8217;s exercises, but you should plan to complete two exercises during your weekly lab time (you&#8217;re completing the third as a blog posting). All lab assignments and due dates (we&#8217;ll be checking those in class) are identified on the <a href="schedule.html">class schedule</a> in <span class="lab"><strong>orange</strong></span>.	
					<span class="hilite">Late lab checks will be penalized at 10% <em>per day</em> (not class period)</span>.</li>
					<li><span class="firstline">Midterm Evaluation.</span> About halfway through the semester, it&#8217;ll be time for a <em>kumbaya</em> of sorts, let the instructor know how you&#8217;re doing&#8212; &#8220;great,&#8221; &#8220;bored,&#8221; &#8220;frustrated&#8221;: get it out. It&#8217;ll be anonymous of course, but it will help you and the instructor do any course correcting if needed. Watch the <a href="schedule.html">class schedule</a> in October for this; this evaluation is worth an easy-peasy ten points. <span class="hilite">Late submissions will not be accepted</span>.</li>
					<li><span class="firstline">Exams and Quizzes.</span> There will be one performance (interpreted) exam&#8212;the final&#8212;given during the semester. Periodic unannounced quizzes will be given, to be completed outside of class in a primarily written/short answer format, and designed to assess your knowledge of concepts discussed in lectures, readings, and handouts. There&#8217;s only one exam; unless there&#8217;s an exceptional reason, <span class="hilite">there is no makeup final exam</span>. <a href="schedule.html">See the class schedule</a>.</li>
