				<h3>Expectations and Requirements</h3>
				<p>The <a href="/uvuasl/3310/ch9_ridcpc.html#tenet7"><span class="smallcaps">RID</span> Code of Professional Conduct</a> encourages interpreters to engage in professional development, including familiarity and reading of current literature in the field. Interpreters must not only understand the communication needs of Deaf people but also 1) be familiar with the academic research of the field and 2) be able to articulate the cogent and salient points found in the core issues that face the field today.</p>
				<h3>Evaluation Criteria for Blog Posts and Lab Assignments</h3>
				<p>This rubric primarily addresses the content of your blog postings but could also be generalized to assess the content of your lab assignments.</p>
				<h6><strong>Please note:</strong> The points breakdown below isn&#8217;t just an arbitrary explanation of requirements; you&#8217;ll be held to these scoring standards. If you want to earn a 20 on a posting, you really need to show it.</h6>

				<h3>FAQs</h3>
				<p>Students inevitabily say or ask:</p>
				<p class="spacer"></p>
				<p><em>&#8220;This is all I could think of. Even though it&#8217;s only a couple of lines, it&#8217;s okay, right?&#8221;</em></p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="firstline">Answer:</span> Put it this way: partially completing the assignment will earn you partial credit. As stated in the syllabus, you&#8217;ll be graded on your own merits. You decide what you can live with.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
				<p><em>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t agree with what s/he said about the topic. I think there&#8217;s a different way to look at it, but I don&#8217;t want to offend him/her by saying that. I'll just back off.&#8221;</em></p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="firstline">Answer:</span> Kudos for being sensitive to others&#8217; needs; if we can&#8217;t value differing opinions, we&#8217;re never going to be able to work with our colleagues. This is as much a lesson in diplomacy as it is in tact and persuasion. Do all you can to further the discussion&#8212;&#8220;I know Brian said X, but I feel like...&#8221; or &#8220;Stacy had a good point with X but what about Y and Z?&#8221;&#8212;while allowing others their dignity.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
				<p><em>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t understand how to reference everything so I just did it my way. Is that okay?&#8221;</em></p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="firstline">Answer:</span> No. A large part of doing research is properly documenting your findings. To make this easier, there are standards in place; use the <span class="smallcaps">APA</span> referencing and works cited style&#8212;standard for writing about the social sciences and humanities&#8212;and stick with it. Be consistent. Determine how <span class="smallcaps">APA</span> style typographically treats and references various types of sources.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Blog Posting and Peer Evaluation Topics </h3>
				<p>See <a href="schedule.html">class schedule for reading materials</a>.</p>
				<p><span class="firstline">Sep 9:</span> Response(s) to/evaluation of Witter-Merrithew&#8217;s article and Colonomos&#8217; typology </p>

				<p><span class="firstline">Dec 7:</span> Posting/response(s) to Exercise 7.3 (p. 169) and Colonomos&#8217; model of meaning construction</p>
				<h3>Specifications</h3>
				<p>Your writing/postings/evaluations must:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>when referencing, <span class="firstline">use APA formatting and style</span> (Internet sources are listed below)</li>
					<li>be <span class="firstline">spellchecked</span> (both electronically and manually checked)</li>
					<li>be <span class="firstline">at least two full pages in length</span> (longer is perfectly acceptable) and stapled together (no &#8216;dog-ears&#8217;)</li>
					<li>utilize college-level thought, reasoning, research, and writing</li>
					<li>not consist of a single paragraph or a couple of lines. There are realizations to be had and concepts to be elaborated; show that you&#8217;ve got something to say</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Content</h3>
				<p>Common problems:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="firstline">Avoid analysis that is obvious and superficial, rather than original, personal, and in-depth.</span> Relate your feelings and reactions in an academic way; statements like &#8220;I think this article is just so cool&#8221; or &#8220;This lady&#8217;s Web site is just awesome!&#8221; are filler and do not represent a true, academic perspective.</li>
					<li><span class="firstline">Use credible, factual sources.</span> Books, journals, and periodicals are among the most reliable references. While the Internet is easy to search and may contain a number of seemingly good articles or sources, <em>beware the anonymity and undocumented nature of the Internet</em>.</li>
					<li><span class="firstline">Work towards a thesis.</span> If you&#8217;re going to make a point, arguments/positions need a thesis statement. Be narrow and specific, take a stance/position on an issue, and don&#8217;t ask additional questions (unless it also answers them).</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Mechanics</h3>
				<p>Here are some fairly common problems to watch for in your paper:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><span class="firstline">Awkward sentence structures.</span> Avoid fragments and run-on sentences. &#8220;The Hartford school helped refine <span class="smallcaps">ASL</span>. And standardize it too.&#8221; is a fragment.</li>
					<li><span class="firstline">Incorrect punctuation.</span> Don&#8217;t misuse commas and semicolons. Semicolons only link two relatedâ€”but independentâ€”sentences together.</li>
					<li><span class="firstline">Incorrect use of it&#8217;s.</span> It&#8217;s = It is (&#8220;It is a tragedy.&#8221;); its = belonging to &#8216;it&#8217; (&#8220;Its process was way off.&#8221;)</li>
					<li><span class="firstline">Incorrect use of quotation marks and italics.</span> Book, play, poem, periodical, film/TV titles should be <em>italicized</em> or <u>underlined</u>, not in quotation marks.</li>
					<li><span class="firstline">Spelling errors.</span> Yes, it&#8217;s an ASL class. But you&#8217;re also writing college-level thinking. <a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=438532">Use a spell checker and proofread your papers</a>. </li>
					<li><span class="firstline">Use of colloquial/conversational slang expressions.</span> Words such as &#8220;like,&#8221; &#8220;way,&#8221; &#8220;y&#8217;all,&#8221; are not acceptable. </li>
					<li><span class="firstline">Failure to cite references.</span> See the syllabus for clarification. If you use any reference&#8212;printed or otherwise&#8212;it must be cited. Otherwise, you are plagiarizing and in danger of failing the assignment. If you use conversations as sources, make sure to cite them.</li>
				</ol>
				<p><a href="http://www.retinart.net/miscellaneous/grammar">Here&#8217;s some additional help with writing concerns and mechanics</a>. Mind the <span class="smallcaps">HTML</span> assistance; the principles are still applicable.</p>
