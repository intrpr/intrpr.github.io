\f0\i0\fs20 \cf0 It was a real and concrete hunger that had no specific date of departure. Even though it never reached the rigor of the hunger experienced by some people I know, it was not the hunger ex\'ad perienced\kerning1\expnd7\expndtw39
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 by those who undergo a tonsil operation or are dieting. On the contrary, our hunger was of the type that arrives unan\'ad nounced and unauthorized,\kerning1\expnd8\expndtw40
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 making itself at home without an end\kerning1\expnd8\expndtw40
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 in sight. A hunger that, if it was not softened as ours was, would take over our bodies, molding them into angular shapes. Legs; arms, and fingers become skinny. Eye sockets become deeper, making the eyes almost disappear. Many of our classmates ex\'ad perienced this hunger and today it continues to afflict millions of Brazilians who die of its violence every year.

\fs21 \cf0 In order to understand the meaning of dialogical practice, we have to put aside the simplistic understanding of dialogue as a mere technique. Dialogue does not represent a\kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-4
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 somewhat false path that I attempt to elaborate on and realize in the sense of involving the ingenuity of the other. On the contrary, dialogue characterizes\kerning1\expnd-3\expndtw-14

 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 this\kerning1\expnd-3\expndtw-13
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 sense, dialogue is a way of knowing and should never be viewed as a mere tactic to involve students in a particular task. We have to make this point 
\f2\i\fs20 very 
\f0\i0\fs21 clear. I engage in dialogue not necessarily because I like the other person. I engage in dialogue because I recognize the\kerning1\expnd-2\expndtw-6
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 social\kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-1
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 and not merely the\kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-3

\fs22 By

 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 change structures. On the contrary, one cannot conceive of objectivity without subjectivity. Neither can exist without the other, nor can they be dichotomized. The separation of objectivity from subjectivity, the denial of the latter when analyzing reality or acting upon it, is objectivism. On the other hand, the denial of objectivity in analysis or action, resulting in a subjectivism which leads to solipsistic positions, denies action itself by denying objec\'ad tive reality. Neither objectivism nor\kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-3

\cf0 It is not surprising that the banking concept of education regards men as adaptable, manageable beings. The more students work at storing the deposits entrusted to them, the less they develop the critical consciousness which would result from their intervention in the world as transformers of that world. The more completely they accept the passive role imposed on them, the more they tend simply to adapt' to the world as it is and to the fragmented view of reality deposited in them.\

\cf0 Once the thematic demarcation is completed, each specialist pre\'ad sents to the interdisciplinary team a project for the "breakdown" of his theme. In breaking down the theme, the specialist looks for the fundamental nuclei which, comprising l arning units and establish\'ad ing a sequence, give a general view of the theme. As each specific project is discussed, the other specialists make suggestions. These may be incorporated into the project and/or may be included in the brief essays to be written on the theme, These essays, to which bibliographic suggestions are annexed, are valuable aids in training the teacher-students who will work in the "culture\kerning1\expnd8\expndtw40
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 circles."\

\cf0 During this effort to break down the meaningful thematics, the team will recognize the need to include some fundamental themes which were not directly suggested by the peopJe during the preced\'ad ing investigation.\kerning1\expnd8\expndtw40

 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 to be necessary, and also corresponds to the dialogical character of education. 
\fs24 If 
\fs23 educational programming is dialogical, the teacher\'ad students also have the right to participate by including themes not previously suggested. I call the\'b7 latter type of theme "hinged themes," due to their function. They may either facilitate the con\'ad nection between two themes in the program unit, filling a possible gap between\kerning1\expnd8\expndtw40
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 the two; or they may illustrate the relations\kerning1\expnd8\expndtw40
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 between the general program content and the view of the world held by the people.\kerning1\expnd6\expndtw31

\cf0 If the educators lack sufficient funds to\kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-3
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 carry out the preliminary thematic investigation as described above, they can-with a mini\'ad mum\kerning1\expnd7\expndtw35
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 knowledge of the situation-select some basic themes to serve as "codifications to be investigated." Accordingly, they can begin with introductory themes and simultaneously initiate further the\'ad matic investigation.\
\pard\pardeftab720\li152\fi221\ri137\sl259\slmult1\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 One of these basic themes (and one which I consider central and indispensable) is the anthropological concept of culture. Whether men and women are peasants or urban workers, learning to read or enrolled in a\kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-1
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 post-literacy program,\kerning1\expnd8\expndtw40

 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 the instrumental\kerning1\expnd8\expndtw40
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 meaning of the term) is the debate of the concept. As they discuss the world of culture, they express their level of awareness of reality, in which various themes are implicit. Their discussion touches upon other aspects of reality, which comes to be perceived in an increasingly critical manner. These aspects in turn involve many other themes.\
\pard\pardeftab720\li171\fi222\ri126\sl254\slmult1\sb2\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 With the\kerning1\expnd-2\expndtw-6

 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 concept 
\fs26 of\kerning1\expnd-2\expndtw-9
 
\fs23 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 culture, discussed imaginatively in all or most of its dimensions, can provide various aspects of an educational program. In addition, after several days of dialogue\kerning1\expnd8\expndtw40

 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 dis\'ad cussion about nationalism of any interest to us?" My experience shows that when a suggestion is posed as a problem to the group, new themes appear.

\cf0 When, however, at a\kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-1
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 certain pojn't of their existential experience, those who have been invaded begin in one way or another to reject this invasion (to\kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-4
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 which they might earlier have adapted), the profes\'ad sionals, in order to justify their failure, say that the members of the invaded group are "inferior" because they are "ingrates," shiftless," "diseased," or of "mixed\kerning1\expnd8\expndtw40
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 blood."\
\pard\pardeftab720\li142\fi221\ri113\sl256\slmult1\sb2\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Well-intentioned professionals (those who use "invasion" not as deliberate ideology but as the expression of their 
\fs24 own 
\fs23 upbringing) eventually discover that certain of their educational failures must be ascribed, not to the intrinsic inferiority of the "simple men of the people," but to the violence of their own act of\kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-5
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 invasion. Those who make this discovery face a\kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-2
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 difficult alternative: they feel the need to renounce invasion, but patterns of domination are so entrenched within them that this renunciation would become a threat to their 
\fs24 own 
\fs23 identities. To renounce invasion would mean ending their\kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-2
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 dual status as dominated and dominators. It would mean abandoning all the myths which nourish invasion, and starting to incarnate dialogi\'ad cal action.\kerning1\expnd8\expndtw40
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 For this very reason,\kerning1\expnd6\expndtw33
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 it would mean to\kerning1\expnd-2\expndtw-7

 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 And so the fear of freedom takes hold of these men. During this traumatic process, they naturally tend to rationalize their fear with a\kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-1
