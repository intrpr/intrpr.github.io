<h3><strong>ASL-4520-X01 Deaf People and Disability Studies</strong> | Spring 2019</h3>
<h3>This <strong>online-only</strong> course is a seminar-like <span style="background: #ffc;">introduction and examination into the confluence of Deaf people and disability studies.</span> Instructor/student interaction will be in both ASL and <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com">written English</a>. Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to demonstrate they can:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>explain how American society constructs disability and contrast this with perspectives from disability studies and Deaf studies</li>
	<li>describe historical, social, political, religious, philosophical, and cultural influences on both Deaf and disabled people</li>
	<li>describe the complex relationship between Deaf and disability rights groups</li>
	<li>explain how Deaf persons and persons with disabilities construct their own meanings and identities</li>
	<li>articulate ways that the study of Deaf people might inform disability studies’ theoretical underpinnings</li>
	<li>apply principles taught in the course to conduct self-analysis toward understanding societal constructs of disability and Deaf people</li>
</ol>
<h4 style="margin: 1em 0 0 0;"><strong>Additional Learning Objectives</strong></h4>
<p>In addition to the main learning objectives above, students should be able to demonstrate university-level ability in</p>
<ul>
	<li>expressing appropriate and <a href="/courses/474212/pages/course-etiquette-netiquette-and-contributing">expected civil netiquette</a> in online conversations and commentary</li>
	<li>articulating personal reasoning when comparing (the same) and contrasting (different) perspectives and observations</li>
	<li>deducing, constructing, and expressing a research-informed opinion</li>
	<li>producing <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX18-4m-EN0">academic ASL-styled presentations</a> and accurate usage of <a class="inline_disabled" href="http://linguistics.byu.edu/faculty/henrichsenl/APA/APA01.html">APA referencing and citation form</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As you know, this course requires your completely self-directed efforts (a/synchronously working with other colleagues) and fairly good command of web-based technologies and learning environments (video creation, salient discussion, and reporting skills).</p>
<hr />
<h3>Instructor and Class Times</h3>
<p>Instructor: Doug Stringham<br />E-mail: dstringham (at) gmail.com<br />Course URL: <a href="/courses/474212">https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/474212</a><br />Class Period: Online only, 7/Jan 2019 &ndash; 29/Apr 2019</p>
<hr />
<h3>Required Texts</h3>
<ul>
	<li><span style="background: #ffc; font-weight: bold;">Instructor-selected supplemental readings, articles, videos, and similar materials are the required texts for this course. These materials are available in each learning module. Quiz and exam materials and well as class discussions and postings will come from these resources.</li>
	<li>Linton, S. (1998). <em>Claiming disability: Knowledge and identity</em>. New York: New York University Press. This is the stated text for this course, <strong>but we will NOT be using it.</strong> It is an excellent addition to your personal library; if you have purchased the textbook, feel free to keep or return it.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Course Requirements and Expectations</h3>
<ol>
	<li><strong>You’re taking this course for your own reasons.</strong> But despite our diversity and lack of traditional classroom interaction, it is important that we strive to form a community of safety, reflective practice, openness, collegiality, and trust. Our cohesiveness influences how rich the idea exchange is in our assignments and discussions. Thin skins, quick offense, and lack of participation make it difficult to achieve this interactive environment.<br /><br /></li>
	<li><strong>Salient, intelligent, self-expressive, and self-paced skills are requisite for this course.</strong> In short, I can help lead you to water, but you have to want to drink. This is a senior-level seminar course; as such, it is assumed that you can maintain a certain level of self-mastery, scholastic discipline, and responsibility. The attitude and success of this course are dependent on your preparation and interactivity:
		<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
			<li>You’ll be expected to
				<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
					<li>read the assigned materials (listed in each module/discussion),</li>
					<li>identify/note important concepts and themes,</li>
					<li>timely submit assignments well-reasoned and thoughtful posts, and</li>
					<li>appropriately comment on other peer posts and discussions (see rubric for grading expectations).</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>You’ll also complete a summative/comprehensive quiz based on principles identified in y/our readings/viewings and discussions at the end of each unit/module.</li>
			<li>Optimally, you’ll likely have a more successful experience if you set a consistent schedule:
				<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
						<li><strong>Readings</strong> are not overbearing, but they will require time to complete and analyze; <em>caveat lector</em></li>
						<li>Most often, <strong>assignments</strong> are simply (and expected) thoughtful discussion participation, but be aware; some assignments may take more time or planning and time to complete</li>
						<li>Be prepared not only to answer questions but also to ask them; being ill-prepared sets the class back and undermines our classroom community<br /><br /></li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Academic Integrity.</strong> Your assignments and participating are obviously graded on an honor system; ‘completing an assignment’ implies indicates that you have actually read and made a serious attempt to contribute to the assignment. <a href="https://www.turnitin.com">Cheating</a>, misrepresentation, <a href="https://www.plagiarism.org">plagiarism</a>, or any dishonest work violates this honor system, as well as university policy, and may result in the automatic failure of the assignment and/or the course. <a href="http://linguistics.byu.edu/faculty/henrichsenl/APA/APA01.html">When in doubt, cite it out</a>. Further punishment(s) for cheating <a href="https://www.uvu.edu/studentconduct/students.html">may also be levied by university administrators</a>.<br /><br /></li>
	<li><strong>Class participation is important and necessary.</strong> As of this writing, because we are only spending one week on each unit and/or sub-unit, our time will go quickly. <strong>Assignments are due weekly, by Saturday at 11:59 pm</strong> (<em>not</em> Sunday, so I have time to review and offer any correction, if necessary). The value in this course comes from three sources: 1) the readings you analyze, 2) the assignments you submit, and 3) the richness of the discussion about the topic. Unless there is an announced change to the schedule, you are responsible for all timely submissions of assignments. If you’re unable to submit an assignment, I urge you to figure out an alternative method for submitting the assignment. However, if there are compelling circumstances, let’s talk about it.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>This is what you may expect of the instructor:</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>The instructor will not waste your time.</strong> You are spending a significant amount of your time and a fair amount of tuition to learn these principles, data, and connections to y/our profession. That is a great deal of trust, and the instructor takes this seriously.<br /><br /></li>
	<li><strong>The instructor will be fair.</strong> There are no preconceived notions about the skills, abilities, and knowledge that students individually bring into the class community. Indeed, grades are given based on merit progress up (or down) one’s own scale.<br /><br /></li>
	<li><strong>The instructor will evaluate each student on his or her own merits.</strong> As such, grades on curves or comparisons to other students are counterproductive and set false standards. If you earned an 85, you will receive an 85, not an interpretation of someone else’s 85.<br /><br /></li>
	<li><strong>The instructor will treat students with respect.</strong> Just as it is expected of you, so too, you have the right to expect this of the instructor. Belittling, faultfinding, or demeaning student’s thoughts and feelings is inappropriate.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>How is my work evaluated? (or, in other words, “How do I get an A?”)</h3>
<p>Course final grades are determined by combining:</p>
<ul>
	<li>scores on all of the submitted assignments and quizzes</li>
	<li>your performance as committed on your student-teacher contract</li>
	<li>in-course participation</li>
</ul>
<p>While <em>some</em> portions of your coursework and quizzes will test for specific factual who-when-where information (‘remembering’ skills), far less important is your ability to regurgitate facts and figures. Instead, assignments and quizzes are designed to identify how well you internalize principles and knowledge, and then apply them to create solutions to various situations (‘applying’ and ‘analyzing’ skills).</p>
<p>Scoring criteria are clearly defined in rubrics; you‘ll know what you need to do to earn the grade you want. Ultimately, your grade is a reflection of your personal effort and internalization of concepts learned in the course.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Assignments Breakdown</h3>
<p>There are no papers required for this course; assignments are tailored to help expose you to the principles of deafness and disability through a variety of learning styles. One-third of your grade is dependent on well-reasoned, well-researched interactive discussion responses; another one-third of your grade is dependent on your ability to demonstrate how well you’ve learned these principles.</p>

<p><strong>A word about video presentation expectations</strong>: As a class and as Deaf Studies students, you should expect to incorporate Academic ASL presentation styling and execution in your signed work. Presentations should be filmed landscape on a contrasting background with contrasting clothing and appropriate personal styling. If you submit a presentation with citations and references, please film yourself and add the citations in post-production so they can be seen without difficulty. <strong><a title="Video Presentation Styling and Academic ASL" href="https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/474212/pages/video-presentation-styling-and-academic-asl" data-api-endpoint="https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/474212/pages/video-presentation-styling-and-academic-asl" data-api-returntype="Page">Read more details about Video Presentation Styling and Academic ASL</a></strong>.</p>

Course Etiquette, Netiquette, and Contributing

<hr />
<p>Arguably, the most important skills in an online-only class are <strong>communication intent</strong> and <strong>language</strong>. More attention is required when you don’t have a simple way to clarify your intent or a statement you make. Additionally, there is no tone or affect in your online communication so word choice, grammar, and punctuation are crucial. Here are some principles of ‘netiquette,’ or communicating effectively in our interactions.</p>
<p>In your communication with classmates, please:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Clarify <em>and</em> support with evidence the position you take in your answer or reply.</li>
	<li>Suggest ways in which an idea could be more clearly expressed.</li>
	<li>Avoid absolutes. ‘Never,’ ‘always,’ ‘every,’ ‘only,’ ‘none,’ and ‘must’ are examples of absolute language and they typically cause others to be defensive <em>(‘Mary always says that in her posts,‘ ‘You can’t be right because Einstein never made any mistakes...‘)</em> Think twice before including them in a response in a discussion.</li>
	<li>Identify specific passages or sentences where you think the writer misunderstood a concept or applied it incorrectly <em>(“David wrote in his post that Einstein theorized about water and mass, but on page 14, Einstein doesn’t use water in his theory....”)</em>.</li>
	<li>Disagree with a point made in an answer <em>(“I think Einstein was talking about mass, not gravity...”)</em>, <strong>not</strong> the other person <em>(“Mary was wrong when she said Einstein was talking about...”)</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s okay to disagree with another person’s views, but please:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Be constructive and respectful in your disagreement.</li>
	<li>Politely critique a position on an issue, <strong>not</strong> the person.</li>
	<li>Avoid sarcasm, profanity, or informal language that would be considered rude or argumentative.</li>
	<li>State precisely the point you disagree with <em>(“I agree with Mary’s first two points, but I don’t quite see the third point about Einstein in the same way. I’ll explain....”)</em></li>
	<li>Offer reasons why you think a person’s view is incorrect and always support your position by citing the text or other sources.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>Student Responsibilities</h3>
<p>The purpose of discussion assignments is for us to thoughtfully contribute and exchange ideas about the academic topics covered in this course. Personally and collectively, these discussions should help you better understand the complex concepts we’re striving to understand, but only inasmuch as you contribute to the richness of the discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Last-minute posts that are inaccurate, sloppy, unorganized, and unclear don’t help this process</strong>. We all come from a diversity of backgrounds where clearly explaining feelings and observations may or may not be a native ability. If you find that a post is unclear or inaccurate, politely ask your classmate for further clarification or to point out the inaccuracy. If someone replies to your post with a question, you owe her/him the courtesy of a response.</p>
<p><strong>You are also responsible for posting your answers and replies on time</strong>. The instructor will also comment where appropriate on the posts or discussion threads and may correct inaccuracies or lead discussions where there is confusion. I also look forward to reading (and rewarding) posts or discussions that are particularly thoughtful, insightful, or well-written.</p>
<h4>Ground Rules for Course Discussions, Email, and Internet Postings</h4>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Participate</strong>. Please participate in the shared learning environment, avoid lurking in the background. It is not enough to log in and read the discussion thread of others. For the maximum benefit (and grade), everyone is intended to contribute.</li>
	<li><strong>Report glitches</strong>. Discussion forums are electronic; they can break. If you experience difficulty participating, please contact or inform your instructor of the issue so that it can be corrected as soon as possible.</li>
	<li><strong>Help others</strong>. If you have more experience with online discussion forums than another classmate, please help. Be a good citizen and others will appreciate it. Karma.</li>
	<li><strong>Be patient</strong>. <em>Please read everything</em> in the discussion thread before replying. This will help you avoid repeating something that someone else has already contributed. Recognize the concepts and ideas with which you agree and suggest alternatives for those with which you don’t.</li>
	<li><strong>Be brief, but answer the question.</strong> Be clear in your word choice and articulate your point, but don’t be preachy or pompous. Be direct, stay on point, and don’t lose yourself &mdash; or your classmates &mdash; in wordy sentences or paragraphs.</li>
	<li><strong>Use proper writing and citation style</strong>. This is important; write more like a term paper and less like a text message (<a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com">Hemingway app can help with this)</a>. Correct spelling, grammatical construction, and <a href="http://retinart.net/miscellaneous/grammar">sentence structure</a> are expected in every other writing activity associated with scholarship and academic engagement. Online discussions are no different. </li>
	<li><strong>Cite your sources</strong>. Also crucial; if your contributions to the conversation include authored material of others (e.g., books, videos, or journal articles, whether online or in print), give the proper attribution. The citation style for Deaf Studies is APA; there are several helps to using APA style, but I can recommend <a href="http://linguistics.byu.edu/faculty/henrichsenl/APA/APA01.html">Brigham Young University Linguistics</a> and <a href="https://library.nmu.edu/guides/userguides/style_apa.htm">Northen Michigan University Olsen Library</a> as good resources.</li>
	<li><strong>Emoticons and text language</strong>. Don’t confuse online courses with social media and text messaging. ”kewl :-),” ”nvm,” and “c u l8r” are not part of the academic dialogue. Please avoid.</li>
	<li><strong>Respect diversity</strong>. Be sensitive to the multicultural, multi-able, multilingual community in which we are participating. Please avoid language that is &mdash; or might be considered &mdash; offensive toward others. (Pro tip: if you think something might be offensive, it probably is. Time away and/or a second opinion can be really helpful.) Racist, hetero/homosexist, and derogatory or sarcastic commentary directed at religious beliefs, disabilities, and age is unacceptable. Rich debate is encouraged about topics in which we might disagree, but word choice must always be measured. Thanks.</li>
	<li><strong>No YELLING!</strong> This probably goes without saying, but using bold and/or uppercase letters is the equivalent of stomping around and yelling at somebody (NOT TO MENTION BEING HARD ON THE EYE).</li>
	<li><strong>Refrain from flaming and rants</strong>. We’ve kind of stated this in numbers 4, 9, and 10 above, but to reiterate, criticism is acceptable and encouraged if required, but it must be constructive, well-meaning, and well-articulated. We’re college students; no tantrums. Rants and profanity directed at other contributors are simply unacceptable and may result in assignment (and even course grade) penalty.</li>
	<li><strong>You can’t ‘un-ring the bell</strong>.’ As I said at the beginning, language is arguably your only tool in an online environment. Step carefully. How others perceive you will be decided by your interaction. Once you’ve clicked ‘Submit’ or ‘Send,’ you’ve rung the bell. Re-read your post before you ‘Send.’ This will tell you a lot about whether your grammar and sentence structure are correct, your tone is appropriate, and your contribution clear or not.</li>
</ol>
<p>Always review your written posts and responses <strong>before you submit</strong> to ensure that you’ve conveyed exactly what you intended. This is an excellent opportunity to practice proofreading, revision, and rewriting skills &mdash; all valuable assets in the professional world for which you are now preparing.</p>

[Evaluation] Student/Teacher Contract
---------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4>If you haven’t read the syllabus, <strong>go back and do that</strong>. Completing this assignment means that you’ve read and understood your responsibilities in the syllabus. This assignment is due <strong>Saturday, January 12, 2019</strong>, and is worth ten points. Late submissions will be accepted but not graded.</h4>
<hr />
<p>Participating in an online-only course requires self-discipline and consistency. But I value the relationship that we’re creating here as part of this class, and I’m committed to helping you achieve what you’re hoping for in this course. If you’ve had me as an instructor before, the concept of a student/teacher contract is not new.</p>
<p>Participating in assignments and demonstrating content mastery will help determine a large measure of your final grade in this class. However, I’m asking you here to consider a contract between you and me that will help determine the evaluation and measurement of your class performance this semester.</p>
<p>What grade do you want? Why? Don’t just say, “I want an A." Of course, you want an A. But why? What will that represent? More importantly, thoughtfully include what requirements, stipulations, and conditions you’ll need to satisfy in order to warrant the grade you want to earn from this class. How can I help you?</p>
<p>Please be detailed as possible.</p>
<p>Additionally, explain what you feel the I can do/should do to enable your best performance. (This should be a serious effort to create a contract with me which will reflect your personal effort and internalization of concepts learned in the course.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no submission of this assignment from Canvas; use the Student/Teacher Contract form from <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1MHIVouo5t4EmvzzSmAUJxcJNdctnbcQFWbd1K_e2Q94">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1MHIVouo5t4EmvzzSmAUJxcJNdctnbcQFWbd1K_e2Q94.</a></p>

1. Defining ‘Disability’.
This module aims to compile a definition of disability while also looking at historical and contemporary definitions of disability from historical (religious and philosophical), social, legal, and cultural perspectives.
---------------------------------------------------------------->
<p><img src="http://www.aclumich.org/sites/default/files/disability-reform.jpg" alt="" data-decorative="true" /></p>
<h6>http://www.aclumich.org/sites/default/files/disability-reform.jpg</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to have a productive discussion about ‘disability,’ we need some common terminology, background, and experience. In this first unit, using definitions from other scholars, organizations, and national/governmental policy, we want to</p>
<ol>
	<li>narrow our focus of ‘disability’ in this course (in other words, on what kind of disabilities are we focusing)</li>
	<li>create a general definition of ‘disability’</li>
	<li>understand historical, societal, political, and cultural perspectives of disability</li>
</ol>
<p>You’ll be expected to complete readings (listed in each module/discussion) and answer questions/comment on peer answers. You’ll complete a summative/comprehensive quiz based on principles identified in y/our readings/viewings and discussions at the end of this unit/module.</p>
<p>To be clear, in this course, we will narrow our discussions and readings to <strong>sensory-based experiences</strong> (sight, hearing, mobility, physical embodiment, and society’s at-large response to these conditions) and <em>not</em> cognitive/intellectual or emotional disabilities. This decision is not intended to minimize these domains of disability &mdash; there are rich narratives, research, and debate available in these areas, some of which you may have personal experience &mdash; but because the focus of this course is on the intersectionality of deaf people and disability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>So we can make the word ‘disability’ relatively consistent throughout our discussions, <strong>based on what you learned from our readings this week, use them to construct a well-reasoned and defensible evolved and contemporary definition of disability.</strong></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Briefly <strong>identify</strong> where past/outdated notions of ‘handicap’ or ‘impairments’ were used</li>
	<li><strong>Discuss</strong> and <strong>elaborate on</strong> how they are referenced today.</li>
	<li>What did you observe or learn that you did not understand or expect?</li>

<p>In this subunit, we’ll take some time to look at religious and philosophical ideologies &mdash; historic and current &mdash; that comment on disability.</p>
<h4><strong>Based on what you learned from our readings this week, choose a scriptural text/passage from any religious tradition</strong> (i.e., Jewish, Christian, Islamic, Eastern, etc.) <strong>or a philosophical tenet</strong> (i.e., Greek, Roman, Renaissance, etc.) <strong>that demonstrates and defines disability</strong>.

<p>In this subunit, as we shift generally from a <em>medical</em> model to a <em>social</em> model of disability, we’ll evaluate legislation and other policy that have been passed to enable (or, in some cases, even further estrange) people with disabilities and their participation in society.</p>
<h4>Based on what you learned from our readings and your research this week, <strong>compile an annotated bibliography that focuses on a specific topic within the domain of disability</strong> (i.e., legalized examples of marginalization, legislative landmarks for disabilities for a specific country, or even a specific disability).</h4>
<ul>
	<li>What did you observe or learn that you did not understand or expect?</li>

<p>In this final subunit of contexting disability, we look at contemporary cultural &mdash; humor, literary, visual, and popular media &mdash; perspectives on modern disability. People with disabilities have long developed artistic expressions for creative outlets about personal experiences with disability; although there are only one or two readings, this week we’re going to hyperfocus on a recent short film and performances in popular reality talent television programs.</p>
<h4>First, <strong>watch the performances of Samuel Comroe and DJ Demers, and “Lost Voice Guy” Lee Ridley,</strong> all recent performers on <em>America’s</em> and <em>Britain’s</em> <em>Got</em> <em>Talent</em>. Then <strong>watch the Huawei holiday video</strong> featuring Academy Award Winner Maisie Sly, <strong>and the two companion documentary videos</strong>. In your post,</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Evaluate</strong> either/or:
		<ul>
			<li>comedians Samuel Conroe and DJ Demers (<strong>compare</strong> and <strong>contrast</strong> their content and <strong>evaluate</strong> the related program setup and pre-narrative)</li>
			<li>“Lost Voice Guy” Lee Ridley (<strong>evaluate</strong> his presence, content, delivery, reactions and behavior of the judges and onstage hosts, and anything striking from the online commentary links)</li>
			<li>Huawei/StorySign case study (<strong>compare and contrast</strong> the framing of the little girl in her environment and the commentary and motivation of the app developers’ video and deaf community leaders’ video)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Are the comedians artistically expressing about disability or just making fun of one’s condition?</li>
	<li>Do you think different national cultures react differently to disability? Why?</li>
	<li>Remember to comment, challenge, or elaborate on your peer’s posts.</li>
	<li>What did you observe or learn that you did not understand or expect?</li>

2. Defining Disability Studies
This module aims to trace the foundation and growth of disability studies: what prompted its creation, what principles does it espouse, how is ’disability’ framed by disability studies, what is ‘ableism’?

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability_studies">formal domain of disability studies </a>is born out of a social model of disability (cf., our last unit on 20th and 21st century social context), seeing one’s life as his/her own reality, and not first as ‘defective’ or ‘impaired’ or ‘abnormal.’ This informs a differently-centered perspective of the human experience than many people are used to seeing and opens up discussions about race, linguistics, history, sexuality, art, eschatology, sport, politics, and human rights, all looking way past ‘disability’ as barrier and seeing the world from a more familiar center.</p>

<p>In this subunit, based on how a social model of disability empowers people, we’ll step past the domain of disability studies in general and look at what shapes the personal identities of people with disabilities. This unit does have a few readings but the majority of narrative here comes from personal stories that highlight how people have owned and leveraged their unique life situations.</p>
<h4>Based on what you learned from our readings this week, <strong>identify</strong> and <strong>evaluate</strong> existing (and changing?) behaviors and attitudes towards disabilities during this time.</h4>
<ul>
	<li>What did you observe or learn that you did not understand or expect?</li>
</ul>
<p><br />This week’s posting is similar to a few weeks ago, another 3-2-1 assignment. After viewing a few of these TED presentations (choose from at least three), contact a classmate &mdash; interview a different one than before, and, likewise, be interviewed by a different person &mdash; and compare and contrast some of the behaviors and attitudes of the speakers and audience you observed: 3 things you learned, 2 things that you thought were interesting, and 1 question you still have. Post your responses from/to each other in the discussion.</p>

<p>By comparison (and likely more familiar to you if it is your major) is the incredibly rich and deep domain of Deaf studies: the formalized area of study that, like disability studies, also looks at the intersectionality of race, linguistics, history, sexuality, art, eschatology, sport, politics, and human rights of &mdash; this time, deaf &mdash; people. Deaf studies enables interested observers to look at the world from another different and experiential center.</p>
<p>In this unit, you’ll have a few brief readings at what informs Deaf studies. But you’ve already had a few semesters of exposure to and other readings about the field of Deaf studies.</p>

<p>In this subunit, based on historical and social models of experience central to Deaf studies, we’ll briefly look at how Deaf people construct personal identities. We want to evaluate, compare, and contrast Deaf studies in a similar way that we looked at disability studies: How did it originate? What kinds of models influence how Deaf studies looks at the life experience of deafness.</p>
<p>This unit does have a few readings but you should also choose at least one of the four presentations to view; consider how the narrator makes behavioral or attitudinal choices to shape her/his unique identity; how are audience members shown to respond?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Based on what you learned from our readings and viewings this week, <strong>identify</strong> and <strong>evaluate</strong> existing and evolving perspectives on the identities of deaf people.</h4>

<h4>It’s taken us a few weeks to get here, but now we’re to the heart of the matter.</h4>
<ul>
	<li>We’ve worked through a definition of as well as reviewed historical, religious, social, legal, and cultural perspectives of disability</li>
	<li>We’ve built a framework of both disability and Deaf studies and explored how identities are formed</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you have a better understanding of these domains, in this final unit, we’ll compare, contrast, and micro-examine some of the most difficult questions in these fields: within these frameworks, how does <em>Deafness</em> influence <em>disability</em>?</p>
<ul>
	<li>Are Deaf people disabled?</li>
	<li>Is Deaf studies a separate domain or merely a subset of disability studies, or is disability studies an outgrowth of deaf studies?</li>
	<li>Do disability rights policies and initiatives apply to the deaf community?</li>
	<li>This unit has several readings on how some people reconcile a Deaf identity with disability: do you agree with or find the arguments credible and reliable?</li>
	<li>Do/Should Deaf rights policies and initiatives apply to the greater disability community? (One subsection of study here might deaf athletes and inclusion in the Paralympic movement.)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Based on this understanding of disability and Deaf studies as well as what you learned from our readings this week, like in a previous week, <strong>evaluate</strong>, <strong>construct</strong>, and <strong>describe</strong> a Venn diagram that demonstrates what disability and deaf studies, rights, culture, and identities have &mdash; and do not have &mdash; in common.</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Evaluate</strong>, <strong>construct</strong>, and <strong>describe</strong> your thoughts on a Venn diagram that compares and contrasts your significant changes. (see <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/venn-diagram">https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/venn-diagram</a> for an example)</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This week, we flip the question: within these frameworks of both disability and Deaf studies, how does <em>disability</em> personally influence Deafness? What do deaf and disability identities have &mdash; and not have &mdash; in common?</p>
<h4>Based on what you learned from our readings and viewings last week, <strong>conduct</strong> and <strong>report observations from an interview of a deaf person about disability</strong> (not yourself or a family member or someone in this class) <strong>in your post</strong>.</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Converse with someone from the local community about their perspective of disability and deafness; this could be a friend or school cohort or neighbor.</li>
	<li>You might ask him/her about his/her own perspective of his/her deafness as disability or discuss his/her feelings about how businesses offer deaf people ‘disability solutions’ (e.g., using reduced-price bus passes or early airplane boarding or braille cards or wheelchairs): in situations like this and others, is one ‘Deaf’ or ‘disabled’?</li>
	<li>Remember to comment, challenge, or elaborate on your peer’s posts.</li>
	<li>What did you observe or learn that you did not understand or expect?</li>
</ul>

[Discussion] How do DeafDisabled people construct identities?
---------------------------------------------------------------->

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within the frameworks of Deaf and disability studies, there is also focus on <em>intersectionality</em>: the overlap and exploration of multiple classes, values, and identities (i.e., gender, race, ability, sexual orientation, religiosity, political leaning). While there has been recent high emphasis in Deaf/sexual orientation and Deaf/race intersectionality, Deaf and disability (sometimes called ‘Deaf plus’ or ‘Deafdisabled’) is still relatively unexplored, misunderstood, and somewhat taboo (cf. Burke, 2014; and Fisher, Mirus, &amp; Napoli, 2018).</p>
<p>Areas of current strong focus on <em>Deaf/disability</em> intersectionality within the Deaf-world include Deafblindness, Deaf + intellectual disability, and Deaf + mobility disability. How do people who confront a Deafdisabled person develop or reject that identity? There are a few other short readings this week, but you should plan to focus mostly on Meredith Burke’s 2014 graduate thesis, “Ableism in the Deaf Community and the Field of Deaf Studies: Through the Eyes of a DeafDisabled Person.” An ethnonarrative, Burke tells her own story of evolving from outside-imposed labels to self-identity.</p>
<h4>Based on what you learned from our readings and viewings this week, <strong>identify</strong> and <strong>evaluate how disabled intersectional identities inform the Deaf experience</strong>.</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Is Burke (and others you read about) Deaf, disabled, or Deafdisabled?</li>

<p>Finally, in wrapping up this course, we need a brief exploration into pragmatic applications of what we’ve learned; as university graduates and future service providers, you’ll likely be working in social services, interpreting, educational, and even administrative environments. How might all these identities and perspectives impact your future work in these fields or as a member of society?</p>
<h4>Based on what you learned from our readings and viewings this week, <strong>identify</strong> and <strong>evaluate</strong> how you think disabled intersectional identities might impact your decision-making processes in these kinds of environments?</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Will what you have learned impact the way you make decisions in, say, an interpreting scenario or policy decision or as a parent? <strong>Identify</strong> and <strong>defend</strong> your reasoning.</li>

Compiling an Annotated Bibliography
---------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Expectations and Requirements</h3>
<p>Annotated bibliographies provide us with opportunities to research and compile lists of academic texts for later purposeful continued study. They are simply a formal organized list of sources (books, journal articles, magazines, internet resources, etc.,) with an annotation or description of each source, and are written to be informative, indicative, evaluative, or all three.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Specifications</h3>
<div class="alert alert-danger">Please remember <strong>only</strong> PDF files (<em>not</em> .doc, .docx, .odt, .pages, etc.) will be accepted in Canvas. <strong>You</strong> are responsible for any delays or missed points that result by not submitting a proper file.</div>
<p>Make life a little easier; start with one of these templates:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://intrpr.info/library/template/template_AB.doc">Microsoft Word .doc template</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QxXNeBsEWeLEG8acukewAQOReSrHy4p39uQ9xhrvtk8/edit?usp=sharing">Google Docs template</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://intrpr.info/library/template/template_AB.odt">OpenOffice .odt template</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://intrpr.info/library/template/template_AB.pages">Apple Pages .pages template</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Your bibliographies must:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>use APA formatting and style</strong> (Internet sources are listed below)</li>
	<li>be <strong>typed</strong> (handwritten papers will not be accepted; don&rsquo;t laugh, you&rsquo;d be surprised...)</li>
	<li>be <strong>spellchecked</strong> (both electronically and manually checked)</li>
	<li>be <strong>single-spaced using only one-inch margins</strong> (not 1.25" or 1.5"; and, after the first reference line, indent .5" (see sample in syllabus)</li>
	<li>use <strong>12 pt type</strong> (not 13 or 14 pt)</li>
	<li>contain&nbsp;<strong>at least six references and appropriate annotations</strong> (see the sample below)</li>
	<li>include a reference to your last name and page number in the upper right corner; no title page, please. See the sample</li>
	<li>utilize college-level thought, reasoning, research, and writing</li>
	<li>compile at least six (more are always welcome; see the rubric below); each annotation should be approximately five to six lines in length (you may not use previous ASL major class texts <em>nor more than one Internet reference</em>)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Content</h3>
<p>Common problems:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Avoid analysis that is obvious and superficial, rather than original, personal, and in-depth.</strong> Relate your feelings and reactions in an academic way; statements like &ldquo;I think this article is just so cool&rdquo; or &ldquo;This lady&rsquo;s Web site is just awesome!&rdquo; are filler and do not represent a true, academic perspective.</li>
	<li><strong>Use credible, factual sources.</strong> Books, journals, and periodicals are among the most reliable references. While the Internet is easy to search and may contain a number of seemingly good articles or sources, <em>beware the anonymity and undocumented nature of the Internet</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mechanics</h3>
<p>Having trouble putting words and sentences together? The <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway Editor is a solid helpful tool</a>. Here are some fairly common problems to watch for in your paper:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Awkward sentence structures.</strong> Avoid fragments and run-on sentences. &ldquo;The Hartford school helped refine ASL. And standardize it too.&rdquo; is a fragment.</li>
	<li><strong>Incorrect punctuation.</strong> Don&rsquo;t misuse commas and semicolons. Semicolons only link two related&mdash;but independent&mdash;sentences together.</li>
	<li><strong>Incorrect use of it&rsquo;s.</strong> It&rsquo;s = It is (&ldquo;It is a tragedy.&rdquo;); its = belonging to &lsquo;it&rsquo; (&ldquo;Its process was way off.&rdquo;)</li>
	<li><strong>Incorrect use of quotation marks and italics.</strong> Book, play, poem, periodical, film/TV titles should be <em>italicized</em>, not in quotation marks.</li>
</ol>

<h3>FAQs</h3>
<p>Every semester, students say or ask:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t enough books or references.&rdquo;</dt>
	<dd>Nothing could be further from the truth. <a href="http://www.uvu.edu/library/">UVU and hundreds of other libraries</a>, through the intercollegiate library sharing programs that are in place, make the world a very small place when it comes to finding obscure references. This is not supposed to be an easy assignment; you&rsquo;re going to have to dig for some of these references.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve looked everywhere, but there just aren&rsquo;t enough references about my topic.&rdquo;</dt>
	<dd>The assignment doesn&rsquo;t say every reference or source must be laser-focused on your chosen topic, just the majority of them. There are thousands of invaluable references in related fields or topics; for example, if you were compiling sources about legal settings, other indispensable references might be about working in the courtroom or the effect your topic on or by &ldquo;lawyer speak&rdquo; on defendants; references on your topic may benefit from related sources in related fields. Don&rsquo;t feel you must &mdash; in fact, don&rsquo;t &mdash; limit yourself to a very narrow niche only.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>&ldquo;There really aren&rsquo;t very many books or articles on my topic, so I just used internet links, okay?&rdquo;</dt>
	<dd>While you may find many good materials on the internet, you're also going to run into &ldquo;articles&rdquo; written by students just like you. These aren&rsquo;t rigorous, peer-reviewed, substantiated (or even graded!) data that are good content for your bibliographies. Make sure your compilations are a good mix of academic articles, books or book chapters, and, where appropriate, other related references like newspapers and internet articles. <em>Caveat lector:</em> Beware the blog posting and make sure the reference is citable; &ldquo;on the internet, nobody knows you&rsquo;re a dog.&rdquo;</dd>
	<dd>If you find a book via an internet link (e.g. Google Books or archive.org), <em>don&rsquo;t</em> use the link (e.g. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kNvGuljM99wC">http://books.google.com/books?id=kNvGuljM99wC</a>) as your bibliography reference, use the actual resource itself (Nomeland, M. M. &amp; Nomeland, R. E. (2012). <em>The deaf community in America: History in the making.</em> Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>&ldquo;This is all I could find. Even though it doesn&rsquo;t satisfy the requirements, is it okay?&rdquo;</dt>
	<dd>Put it this way: partially completing the assignment will earn you partial credit. As stated in the syllabus, you&rsquo;ll be graded on your own merits. You decide what you can live with.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
	<dt>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t understand how to reference everything so I just did it my way. Is that okay?&rdquo;</dt>
	<dd>No. A large part of doing research is properly documenting your findings. To make this easier, there are standards in place; use the APA referencing and works cited style &mdash; standard for writing about the social sciences and humanities &mdash; and stick with it. Be consistent. Determine how APA style typographically treats and references various types of sources. Listed above are Internet sources which explain how to document your findings.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>
<p>The points breakdown below isn&rsquo;t just an arbitrary explanation of requirements; you&rsquo;ll be held to these scoring standards. If you want to earn full credit on a bibliography, you really need to show it.</p>

Course Etiquette, Netiquette, and Contributing
---------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4>After you read this quick explanation of netiquette expectations, head off to <a href="https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/474212/quizzes/1007466" data-api-endpoint="https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/474212/quizzes/1007466" data-api-returntype="Quiz">take a short quiz</a>.</h4>
<hr />
<p>Arguably, the most important skills in an online-only class are <strong>communication intent</strong> and <strong>language</strong>. More attention is required when you don&rsquo;t have a simple way to clarify your intent or a statement you make. Additionally, there is no tone or affect in your online communication so word choice, grammar, and punctuation are crucial. Here are some principles of &lsquo;netiquette,&rsquo; or communicating effectively in our interactions.</p>
<p>In your communication with classmates, please:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Clarify <em>and</em> support with evidence the position you take in your answer or reply.</li>
	<li>Suggest ways in which an idea could be more clearly expressed.</li>
	<li>Avoid absolutes. &lsquo;Never,&rsquo; &lsquo;always,&rsquo; &lsquo;every,&rsquo; &lsquo;only,&rsquo; &lsquo;none,&rsquo; and &lsquo;must&rsquo; are examples of absolute language and they typically cause others to be defensive <em>(&lsquo;Mary always says that in her posts,&lsquo; &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t be right because Einstein never made any mistakes...&lsquo;)</em> Think twice before including them in a response in a discussion.</li>
	<li>Identify specific passages or sentences where you think the writer misunderstood a concept or applied it incorrectly <em>(&rdquo;David wrote in his post that Einstein theorized about water and mass, but on page 14, Einstein doesn&rsquo;t use water in his theory....&rdquo;)</em>.</li>
	<li>Disagree with a point made in an answer <em>(&ldquo;I think Einstein was talking about mass, not gravity...&rdquo;)</em>, <strong>not</strong> the other person <em>(&ldquo;Mary was wrong when she said Einstein was talking about...&rdquo;)</em>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to disagree with another person&rsquo;s views, but please:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Be constructive and respectful in your disagreement.</li>
	<li>Politely critique a position on an issue, <strong>not</strong> the person.</li>
	<li>Avoid sarcasm, profanity, or informal language that would be considered rude or argumentative.</li>
	<li>State precisely the point you disagree with <em>(&ldquo;I agree with Mary&rsquo;s first two points, but I don&rsquo;t quite see the third point about Einstein in the same way. I&rsquo;ll explain....&rdquo;)</em></li>
	<li>Offer reasons why you think a person&rsquo;s view is incorrect and always support your position by citing the text or other sources.</li>
</ul>
<h4></h4>
<h3>Student Responsibilities</h3>
<p>The purpose of discussion assignments is for us to thoughtfully contribute and exchange ideas about the academic topics covered in this course. Personally and collectively, these discussions should help you better understand the complex concepts we&rsquo;re striving to understand, but only inasmuch as you contribute to the richness of the discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Last-minute posts that are inaccurate, sloppy, unorganized, and unclear don&rsquo;t help this process</strong>. We all come from a diversity of backgrounds where clearly explaining feelings and observations may or may not be a native ability. If you find that a post is unclear or inaccurate, politely ask your classmate for further clarification or to point out the inaccuracy. If someone replies to your post with a question, you owe her/him the courtesy of a response.</p>
<p><strong>You are also responsible for posting your answers and replies on time</strong>. The instructor will also comment where appropriate on the posts or discussion threads and may correct inaccuracies or lead discussions where there is confusion. I also look forward to reading (and rewarding) posts or discussions that are particularly thoughtful, insightful, or well-written.</p>
<h4>Ground Rules for Course Discussions, Email, and Internet Postings</h4>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Participate</strong>. Please participate in the shared learning environment, avoid lurking in the background. It is not enough to log in and read the discussion thread of others. For the maximum benefit (and grade), everyone is intended to contribute.</li>
	<li><strong>Report glitches</strong>. Discussion forums are electronic; they can break. If you experience difficulty participating, please contact or inform your instructor of the issue so that it can be corrected as soon as possible.</li>
	<li><strong>Help others</strong>. If you have more experience with online discussion forums than another classmate, please help. Be a good citizen and others will appreciate it. Karma.</li>
	<li><strong>Be patient</strong>. <em>Please read everything</em> in the discussion thread before replying. This will help you avoid repeating something that someone else has already contributed. Recognize the concepts and ideas with which you agree and suggest alternatives for those with which you don&rsquo;t.</li>
	<li><strong>Be brief, but answer the question.</strong>&nbsp;Be clear in your word choice and articulate your point, but don&rsquo;t be preachy or pompous. Be direct, stay on point, and don&rsquo;t lose yourself &mdash; or your classmates &mdash; in wordy sentences or paragraphs.</li>
	<li><strong>Use proper writing and citation style</strong>. This is important; write more like a term paper and less like a text message (<a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com">Hemingway App can help with this)</a>. Correct spelling, grammatical construction,&nbsp;and <a href="http://retinart.net/miscellaneous/grammar">sentence structure</a> are expected in every other writing activity associated with scholarship and academic engagement. Online discussions are no different.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Cite your sources</strong>. Also crucial; if your contributions to the conversation include authored material of others (e.g., books, videos, or journal articles, whether online or in print), give the proper attribution.&nbsp;The citation style for Deaf Studies is APA; there are several helps to using APA style, but I can recommend <a href="http://linguistics.byu.edu/faculty/henrichsenl/APA/APA01.html">Brigham Young University Linguistics</a> and <a href="https://library.nmu.edu/guides/userguides/style_apa.htm">Northen Michigan University Olsen Library</a>&nbsp;as good resources.</li>
	<li><strong>Emoticons and text language</strong>. Don&rsquo;t confuse online courses with social media and text messaging. &rdquo;kewl :-),&rdquo; &rdquo;nvm,&rdquo; and &ldquo;c u l8r&rdquo; are not part of the academic dialogue. Please avoid.</li>
	<li><strong>Respect diversity</strong>. Be sensitive to the multicultural, multi-able, multilingual community in which we are participating. Please avoid language that is &mdash; or might be considered &mdash; offensive toward others. (Pro tip: if you think something might be offensive, it probably is. Time away and/or a second opinion can be really helpful.) Racist, hetero/homosexist, and derogatory or sarcastic commentary directed at religious beliefs, disabilities, and age is unacceptable. Rich debate is encouraged about topics in which we might disagree, but word choice must always be measured. Thanks.</li>
	<li><strong>No YELLING!</strong> This probably goes without saying, but using bold and/or uppercase letters is the equivalent of stomping around and yelling at somebody (NOT TO MENTION BEING HARD ON THE EYE).</li>
	<li><strong>Refrain from flaming and rants</strong>. We&rsquo;ve kind of stated this in numbers 4, 9, and 10 above, but to reiterate, criticism is acceptable and encouraged if required, but it must be constructive, well-meaning, and well-articulated. We&rsquo;re college students; no tantrums. Rants and profanity directed at other contributors are simply unacceptable and may result in assignment (and even course grade) penalty.</li>
	<li><strong>You can't &lsquo;un-ring the bell</strong>.&rsquo; As I said at the beginning, language is arguably your only tool in an online environment. Step carefully. How others perceive you will be decided by your interaction. Once you've clicked &lsquo;Submit&rsquo; or &lsquo;Send,&rsquo; you've rung the bell. Re-read your post before you &lsquo;Send.&rsquo; This will tell you a lot about whether your grammar and sentence structure are correct, your tone is appropriate, and your contribution clear or not.</li>
</ol>
<p>Always review your written posts and responses <strong>before you submit</strong> to ensure that you&rsquo;ve conveyed exactly what you intended. This is an excellent opportunity to practice proofreading, revision, and rewriting skills &mdash; all valuable assets in the professional world for which you are now preparing.</p>

Video Presentation Styling and Academic ASL
---------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>As a Deaf Studies student, while you need to be competent in using citation and referencing styles, you should also expect to incorporate Academic ASL presentation styling and execution in your&nbsp;signed work.</p>
<p><strong>Academic ASL</strong> refers both a signer&rsquo;s canvas and linguistic choices.</p>
<h3>Signer Canvas</h3>
<p>Presentations should be filmed in front of a contrasting background (darker for Caucasian people; lighter for People of Color) with contrasting clothing and appropriate personal styling. Many of the personal styling guidelines for Academic ASL presentations are the same for interpreters:</p>
<ul>
	<li>contrasting clothing devoid of exaggerated patterns (floral patterns, contrasting repetitive [i.e., houndstooth or plaids] patterns, tartans, flannels, or ginghams)</li>
	<li>clothing styling that either demonstrates professionalism or matches&nbsp;the formality of the setting
		<ul>
			<li>professional clothing that does not create an undue or unprofessional visual distraction</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>minimizing alterations to one&rsquo;s personal appearance that impact a signer&rsquo;s nonmanual marker production and viewer&rsquo;s comprehension:
		<ul>
			<li>minimal to no shiny or dangly jewelry, especially no lip, nose, or eyebrow piercings</li>
			<li>minimal or neutral makeup, including prudence in eyeliner, mascara, and lipstick density and color</li>
			<li>minimal to trimmed fingernail length, shape, and decoration with minimal/neutral/nude coloring</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h4>Lighting and Positioning</h4>
<p>Front lighting should appropriately highlight manual&nbsp;movements and facial expressions but not blow out the signer&rsquo;s facial features nor create a chiaroscuro effect; backlighting should be removed or heavily minimized. Backgrounds should be solid and devoid of contrasting patterns.</p>
<p><img src="http://wemakeonlinevideos.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/landscape-photo.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p><img src="http://wemakeonlinevideos.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Shooting-Video-Yourself-Youtube.jpg" width="100%" /></p>
<p><a href="http://wemakeonlinevideos.com.au/top-6-tips-to-shooting-video-yourself/">http://wemakeonlinevideos.com.au/top-6-tips-to-shooting-video-yourself</a></p>
<p>With easy access to movie production software like <a href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/">iMovie</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/">Final Cut Pro</a>, or even <a href="https://studio.youtube.com">YouTube Studio</a>, adding on-screen titling/citations in post-production is a simple task. When filming yourself for a video presentation, especially an Academic ASL presentation, consider where you place yourself in the frame:</p>
<ul>
	<li>positioning your body and signing space in the left or right of the frame allows placement for on-screen titling (referencing, citations, or other supportive text)</li>
	<li>centering yourself with enough space on the left and right of the frame also creates a professional aesthetic and allow room for on-screen titling if necessary</li>
</ul>
<h3>Signer Linguistic Choices</h3>
<p>While it can be used in other environments, Academic ASL is most often utilized in academic settings and is characterized by slightly larger signing spaces, deliberate word order, more pronounced fingerspelling/numbering, and controlled use of space. <a class="instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file" title="stringham-understanding-register-formality.pdf" href="https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/474212/files/91348947/download?wrap=1" data-api-endpoint="https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/474212/files/91348947" data-api-returntype="File">This handout on register&nbsp;pronunciation&nbsp;helps elaborate what ASL looks like in both informal and formal settings</a>. See the examples below for more defined illustrations.</p>
<h3>Examples of Academic ASL</h3>
<h4>Academic ASL styling, citations, and production</h4>
<ul>
	<li>The definitive guide to Academic ASL production is found in the <a class="inline_disabled external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX18-4m-EN0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formal Academic ASL guidelines by Raychelle Harris</a>. This helpful video has a table of contents in the video description so you can easily skim the video.</li>
	<li><a class=" inline_disabled" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YEEZZpR3Tk">Ben Bahan&rsquo;s StreetLeverage Live&mdash;2016 presentation</a> elaborates not only on how Academic ASL is used but also why it&rsquo;s important for students and interpreters to develop familiarity with it.</li>
	<li><a class=" inline_disabled" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jD6S9ZtUQLQ">Joseph Featherstone&rsquo;s StreetLeverage presentation about IEPs and interpreters</a> is commendable for its lighting and clean on-screen titling.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Positioning and fingerspelling</h4>
<p><a class="inline_disabled external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiPIiUid2ck">Notice how Joy positions her signing space, size, and locates/pronounces her dominant hand when introducing herself and spelling other words</a>. Review your own introduction/spelling in your preassessment (and other GoREACT) texts; how similar or different are they to Joy's work here? What aspects of Joy's work can you incorporate more into your fingerspelling production?</p>
<p>If you're left-handed, <a class="inline_disabled external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hS4f1BZ6EcA">what do you see in Felicia's fingerspelling production/pronunciation that you can use</a>? In what location do both Felicia and Joy produce their fingerspelling in relation to their bodies?</p>
<h4>What should my video look like?</h4>
<p>Jessica was a <em>freshman</em> Deaf Studies student when she submitted <a class="inline_disabled external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXr9HiU5LIU" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> this assignment for her Deaf Culture class</a>. She follows the appropriate guidelines for signer canvas and linguistic choice, and demonstrates post-production citations and referencing. If a freshman can do it, so can you.</p>
