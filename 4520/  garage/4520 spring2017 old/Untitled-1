Examples of Ableism in the Deaf Community
No unread replies. No replies.
I found this on facebook and I thought it'd be worthy for this class to see examples of what kind of ableism in the deaf community looks like

This is what Deaf ableism looks like in our Deaf signing communties.

- better not invite X to Deaf events because X have Bipolar

-X complain not have access. I can't stand that X not try be more positive. X obsessed with no access.

-X should know better that I am not expert on X's disablity and X fell down. X should have known better that we were going to a place where many people walk around.

-why X need SSP or PT? X is not really blind. Self figure out! (SSP: Support Service Provider, PT: Pro Tactile)

-X has a physical disablity. I have to be "patient" communicate with X. X's ASL is not like us -"blaum". Sometimes will feel "slam fall asleep" (People say this to me and other people about me...)

-X is DB. Omg must pay attention where go. Must point point point. Must make sure take turns. Not natural feel Deaf culture. HONESTLY- they miss 50%- point what tell them everything?

-X has bathroom problem. I feel awkward invite 2 people. X and assistant. Oh that assistant help feed X too. VEE! Its doesnt really fit our social group. Really we are not a nursing home.

-i am sick of X asking me repeat information. X need to learn pay attention harder!

-X say that X chronic illness is keeping X home. X shud go to natural doctor but X prefer stay home and do nothing. I think X is BS talk. Chronic pain means hurt everyday- not serious like disease or cancer or disablity.

-My pet peeve! Must sign slow for X. Not fair for me. Im natural fast

Week 1
90 90 unread replies. 90 90 replies.
Davis described how society is established for able-bodied people. I want you to discuss how it is rooted in our current society as it has improved from the past. 

Wendell (Susan) elaborated on the definition of disability and discussed about the identity of disability. What do you think of the definition? 

When you see the term, "disability" what does your subconscious part of your mind say? (I know this is an odd question -- but there's a point.)



Week 2
78 78 unread replies. 78 78 replies.
In Goffman's Stigma and Social Identity (ONLY READ ONE CHAPTER); it discussed the stigma that people have of people who are different from them. Discuss how this implies and affects Deaf and Disability people (when I say Deaf and Disability I mean them as separately).

Wendell's chapter two is very much like Davis' Constructing Normalcy  However in the chapter it discussed Medical Model of Disability and how it affects the social construction of disability. How does it influence each other (medical model and social construction)? 



Week 3
88 88 unread replies. 88 88 replies.
For the past two weeks we've been reading and discussing about normalcy and what disability means. This week's reading(s) is about reclamation of the word disability and be proud of that identity. The long quote has an impact on me because it rings true to me; more personal. When you read this quote and the context around it what are your feelings about it?

"We are everywhere these days, wheeling and loping down the street, tapping our canes, sucking on our breathing tubes, following our guide dogs, puffing and sipping on the mouth sticks that propel our motorized chairs. We may drool, hear voices, speak in staccato syllables, wear catheters to collect our urine, or live with a compromised immune system. We are all bound together, not by this list of our collective symptoms but by the social and political circumstances that have forged us as a group. We have found one another and found a voice to express not despair at our fate but outrage at our social positioning. Our symptoms, though sometimes painful, scary, unpleasant, or difficult to manage, are nevertheless part of the dailiness of life. They exist and have existed in all communities throughout time. What we rail against are the strategies used to deprive us of rights, opportunity, and the pursuit of pleasure" (Linton, p. 4)


The Movie: The Elephant Man. 

How did that movie impact you. How did the movie portray disability in the man? What did it do to your emotions? And more importantly, how did it impact your thinking of disability?



Week 4
80 80 unread replies. 80 80 replies.
Because Foucault is a hard read, I am just going to request that you all read "Docile Bodies" from that book and apply that to what you've read from weeks 1, 2, 3 and enforcing normalcy's book chapter 1 and 6.

I'm doing this before you all get deep into weeks 5-8. 

How does Docile Bodies theory apply to all of your readings?

(They all basically say the same thing)

Inspiration Porn: At first what did you think it meant before you read/saw the video about this? Now what do you think of the term? I'm wondering did you ever have any inspiring moment from a disabled person or people that you say "well if this person can do it then I should be able to do it"?  

When disabled people are just doing their everyday things that "normal" people do why does it inspire so many people to see that?

Spoon Theory, interesting theory, what are your thoughts?







Week 6 & 7
88 88 unread replies. 88 88 replies.
Eli Clare's narrative discussed about how his body is the reason why people are very ignorant to different disability bodies. Some people actually believe that physical disability assoicate with mental disability. How does his story show that body normative = normal?  Also, he discusses that other identity of his : queer does effect his life, how?

Meredith's thesis is a very personal thesis discussing ableism in the deaf community. If you don't know what ableism is, read the first chapter it will expand on the term. She experienced this first hand -- through her life. With what you have read and learned from the past 7 weeks, how does this bring and benefit the deaf community with their learning process of having ableist attitude towards to deafdisabled, deafblind, and disabled and blind people in general to stop the "I am not disabled -- those people are" attitude?

Some movies are on netflix; some are not.

Me Before You

Million Dollar Baby

Forrest Gump

Radio

CAKE

Mainly discuss what you've learned in class imply that in the movie, perhaps you could do one movie now for the first four weeks, then discuss the same movie for the last four weeks to see if you changed your perspective. I will accept that.

This is basically it, Movies with disability characters as a main character or small character, but watch how people treat the person.
