One step closer to getting to a fully-dedicated domain. I'm moving the doug.stringham.net/uvuasl interpreting classes site over to github. Versioning should be better, I don't need an FTP setup to fix pages, and it should be a lot more stable. Hoping to utilize Jekyll to automate the site as well. Thankful to the tutorial at http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages.
