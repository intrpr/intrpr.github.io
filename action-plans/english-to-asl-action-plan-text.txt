Action Plan – ASL Adverbial Nonmanuals
Goal - Skill to improve:
Interpret using effective mouth movements and head movements to signal adverbs and adjectives (e.g. showing size, distance, intensity, etc.);
avoid exaggerated English mouth movements
Source: English Target: ASL
Related terms: nonmanual markers, nonmanual signals, mouth morphemes, mouthing
Root cause - What is causing the error in your work?
 Did you have problems understanding exactly what the hearing person said in English? (comprehension)
 Was the source information unfamiliar to you? (background knowledge)
 Did you have a clear mental picture of what the hearing person meant? (visualization)
 Did you know how to sign with effective mouthing and adverbial nonmanuals? (reformulation)
 Did you mouth many English words exaggeratedly? Did you unconsciously stick out your
tongue or hold your mouth open wide while interpreting? (monitoring)
Knowledge Resources:
1) Read this resource from your center library: “American Sign Language - A Teacher’s Resource Text on Grammar and Culture” (The Green Book) by Charlotte Baker-Shenk and Dennis Cokely, pages 17-25 to learn about the following appropriate ASL mouth movements that convey meaning:

Activities:
1) Film yourself consecutively interpreting “Mike Rowe Celebrates Dirty Jobs” at http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/mike_rowe_celebrates_dirty_jobs.html or another video from www.ted.com). Analyze your mouth movements in the interpretation without listening to the audio. Did you make effective or ineffective choices? Why did this happen? Reinterpret the same video simultaneously and check for errors again.
2) Film yourself simultaneously interpreting the “Job Interview” interactive scenario on the NIC Interview and Performance Practice DVD.

Interpret using clear and effective signs, fingerspelling, and numbers
Source: English Target: ASL
Related terms: clarity, ASL parameters (handshape, movement, location/contact point, palm orientation)
Root cause - What is causing the error in your work?
Did you have problems understanding exactly what the hearing person said in English? (comprehension)
Was the source information unfamiliar to you? (background knowledge)
Did you have a clear mental picture of what the hearing person meant? (visualization) Did you know how to sign what the hearing person meant, using clear and effective ASL production? (reformulation)
Did you think you used clear and effective ASL production, but you mistakenly did not? (monitoring)
 Knowledge Resources:
1) Read this resource: pages 15-31 in “Interpretation Skills: English to American Sign Language” by Marty M. Taylor, Ph.D. (available for purchase at http://www.aslinterpreting.com)
2) Read this resource from your center library: “American Sign Language - A Teacher’s Resource Text on Grammar and Culture” (The Green Book) by Charlotte Baker-Shenk and Dennis Cokely, pages 79-80.
Activities:
1) Do the “Biomechanics Awareness Activity”. (This document can be accessed by center management in the SharePoint QSSR “Materials Library” section.)
2) While interpreting on the VRS floor, have the manager (or mentor, when appropriate) plug- in and concentrate specifically on the use of clear ASL production. Manager (or mentor) should mark instances of both unclear ASL production and effective use and subsequent consequences (negative and positive) in the call. Afterwards, attempt to find a pattern within the examples of unclear ASL production and possible root cause(s).
3) Using the older version of the Language Mentoring DVD in your center, find the clip entitled “Environmental Responsibility”. Watching from 0:40 – 3:00, review the discourse of the Deaf person, focusing on their ASL production (fingerspelling, numbers, etc.). Next, film yourself mirroring the Deaf person in the same clip (0:40 – 3:00), concentrating specifically on your use of clear ASL production. Afterwards, journal your thoughts on the effectiveness of the work. Review the recording – were your signs, fingerspelling, and numbers clear? If not – why?
4) Film yourself simultaneously interpreting the first five minutes from the English video version of the old “Conduct in the Workplace” DVD in your center. Go back and review your recording of the work without sound, recognizing instances of both effective and ineffective ASL production (signs, fingerspelling, numbers) used. Watch the ASL version on the DVD that provided for the same information. How did your interpretation compare with the ASL sample in regards to clear and effective ASL production? Journal potential root cause(s) for ineffective production. Reinterpret the same text simultaneously and check for errors again.



Action Plan – Classifiers
The topic of classifiers is very complex. Classifier errors should be addressed through 1:1 discussions with a Deaf person. Please apply for the Language Mentor Program (LMP). See center management for details.
The LMP is a free program for Sorenson employees designed to enhance ASL fluency. Guidance and support are provided by a trained Language Mentor who is a native user of ASL.



Action Plan – Constructed Action/Dialogue
Goal - Skill to improve:
Improve the act of becoming the characters and objects within an ASL message, and showing action or dialogue rather than telling about it; during constructed action/dialogue, the interpreter’s eye gaze looks towards space/characters
Source: English Target: ASL
Related terms: role-shifting, characterization
Root cause - What is causing the error in your work?
Did you have a clear mental picture of what the hearing person meant? (visualization) Do you usually recognize good opportunities to use constructed action/dialogue? (analysis)
Do you know how to use constructed action/dialogue effectively? (reformulation)
 Knowledge Resources:
1) Read this resource from your center library: “Linguistics of American Sign Language: An Introduction” (Valli, Lucas, and Mulrooney) p. 506-508. The video of the ASL text “Oklahoma City Bombing” described in the article is included on the DVD at the back of the book (4th edition) – watch it and look for the constructed action/dialogue example.
2) Read this resource: http://www.dailywritingtips.com/show-dont-tell/ and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show,_don't_tell. How is this English writing strategy similar to using constructed action and constructed dialogue in ASL?
Activities:
1) Keep a journal of how you, Deaf people, and interpreters use constructed action/dialogue effectively. Which verbs are easy for you to show with constructed action? Journal about why some types of verbs are more of a challenge for you in your work.
2) Look for use of constructed action/dialogue in ASL stories. Watch online videos, such as Deaf Ninja (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L91KVUXRBq8) and “Mountain Dew Story” (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfI5i_i4Dwo&feature=related). Shadow the signer for a short clip. Then pause the video and resign it, using correct eye gaze.
3) Analyze the verbs on the chart below. Sign each verb as just one sign. Then act it out. Make up an English sentence that uses that verb. Translate it and use constructed action in the translation.
4) Film yourself interpreting “LIFE - Must-Watch Scenes” at http://animal.discovery.com/videos/life-on-animal-planet or other videos at www.animalplanet.com. Analyze your work to see where constructed action/dialogue was used effectively and where there were missed opportunities.

bicycle/motorcycle fast food/restaurant walk/drive mother/father Summer/Winter
2) Keep a journal of how contrastive structure is used by Deaf people and interpreters. Which concepts are easy for you to show with contrastive structure? Journal about why some sentence types/concepts are more of a challenge for you in your work.
3) Using the Sorenson VRS Interpreter Training Kit training DVD, record your interpretation of the “Baby Pictures” scenario, focusing specifically on using contrastive structure. Afterwards, journal your thoughts on effective and less effective uses within the work. Review your interpretation – specifically marking effective incorporation of and overlooked opportunities for contrastive structure.



Action Plan – Appropriate Demeanor / Customer Service
 Goal - Skill to improve:
Effectively focus on the interpreting task without distracting noises, distracting movements, or external processing (i.e. mannerisms or statements related to the interpreter’s personal feelings, rather than interpreted concepts) - including facial expressions, side comments, laughter, scratching, adjusting clothing, audible whispering, noises when signing, and other distinctive behaviors related to the interpreter
 Source: English Target: ASL

Activities:
1) On page 253 in the ASL grammar book listed above, there is a list of many directional verbs. Sign each of the verbs on the list and consider how it can be modulated to show who is doing what. Do not forget that these verbs can show number as well (e.g. GIVE can be signed as giving to many people).
2) Watch the online video “How to Train Your Dog to Come When Called” at
http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-train-your-dog-to-come-when-called.navId- 323759.html. Make a list of the potential words that could be interpreted in ASL with directional verbs. Filming yourself consecutively interpreting the video. Be sure to pause between thoughts and be very conscious of how your use space with verbs.
3) Keep a journal of all the directional verbs you use and observe while interpreting. When are they used effectively? When is it more of a challenge?

Activities:
1) Create an audio recording of yourself explaining your three favorite vacations, why you would consider it one of your favorites, and certain things that you did during your time away. Afterwards, note in your journal occasions of movement between concepts or topic transitions which would benefit from appropriate discourse markers to convey a natural English message. Brainstorm potential interpretation options which would incorporate effective discourse markers.
2) Using your audio recording in the previous activity, film your interpretation from English-to- ASL, focusing on appropriately incorporating effective ASL discourse markers (see examples below). Review your interpretation and mark any awkward transitions and potential root causes (reasons that this happens). Journal the potential consequences to both consumers regarding less effective instances of discourse markers used. Think of alternate transitions.
 Examples of some ASL Discourse Markers
 WARN - I will caution you about something INFORM - I need to tell you something
CURIOUS - I will ask you a question now
POINT - this is a rephrasing of my main point; it is important
OK - opening or ending a topic
NOW - opening a topic

2) Have a colleague write five to ten sentences that include English idioms or vocabulary that has several potential meanings depending on context and consumer. Brainstorm effective vocabulary choices that would express message equivalency in a potential English-to-ASL interpretation. Practice your interpretations and jot down concepts that were difficult to convey.
3) Record your English-to-ASL interpretation of the “Immigration” scenario on the NIC Interview and Performance Practice DVD. Afterwards, review your interpretation and gauge your success in producing message equivalency through effective vocabulary choices. Mark instances of incorrect or non-standard vocabulary within the work and journal as to the root cause which contributed to the incorrect or non-standard vocabulary used. Brainstorm more effective options for areas that were marked as incorrect or non-standard. Film a second interpretation of the “Immigration” scenario, specifically focused on more effective vocabulary choices. Review the interpretation and journal improvements in the work and how it affects the overall interpretation.
