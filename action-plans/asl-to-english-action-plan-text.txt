ASL Intrusions

Goal: Reduce unnatural word choices and/or grammatical structure that does not make sense in the target language.

Related terms: source language intrusions; gloss; glossing; interference; literal interpretation; word–for–word; “speaking ASL”; telegraphic speech

Diagnostic Observations (What’s causing the miscues in my work?)
Did you have problems understanding exactly what the Deaf person said in ASL? (comprehension)
Was the source information unfamiliar to you? (background knowledge)
Did you have a clear mental picture of what the Deaf person meant? (visualization) Did you know how to interpret what the hearing person meant, using effective English vocabulary and grammar? (reformulation)
While you were interpreting, did you simultaneously check your interpretation to see if it made sense? (monitoring)
Did you prepare to interpret a concept, but then forget it? (memory)

Readings, Theory, and Library Resources
1) Read “Processing models, a workshop” by David Bar–Tzur – http://www.theinterpretersfriend.org/pd/ws/pcsg-mdls/text.html
2) Read the compression article located on the “Interpreter Discourse: English to ASL Expansion/ASL to English Compression” by L. Finton and R. Smith on CD-ROM. (May not be available in all centers. Resource can be purchased from RIT or www.dawnsignpress.com)
3) Read this resource from your center library: ASL-to-English Interpretation: Say It Like They Mean It by Jean E. Kelly, pages 26-27 (“Primary and Secondary Meanings” and “Being Aware of Assigned English Words”).

Self-paced Production Activities
Using the Consecutive Interpreting book and DVD (from the Effective Interpreting Series by Carol Patrie), find the “Newspaper Layout” video (if unavailable in the center, select another video of an ASL lecture that is approximately five minutes long). Watch short chunks and then interpret. Record your work interpreting segments consecutively. Focus on effective English word choices. Analyze the sample of the recording and document instances of less effective ASL intrusions in the target language. Journal the effects of the interpretation on both the hearing and deaf consumers. Brainstorm more effective word choices that could have been used instead.
Film your ASL-to-English interpretation of “My Deaf Mom, The Cop, and The Law” - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRaBUfeNfAU. Analyze your work specifically regarding word choices in English. Mark opportunities of effectiveness when word choices sounded natural versus less effective instances within the interpretation of unnatural word choices. Journal the consequences to both the hearing person and the deaf person based on the ASL intrusions in the work. Record your second attempt with the same stimulus. Review the work to see the improvements in reducing ASL intrusions. Does the interpretation sound more natural? Journal the perspectives of both the hearing and deaf person after your second attempt.

How are these patterns similar to your ASL to English interpreting work?
2) While interpreting on the VRS floor, have the manager (or mentor, when appropriate) plug- in and concentrate specifically on your use of clear English production. The manager (or mentor) should mark instances of both unclear English production and effective use and subsequent consequences (negative and positive) in the call. Afterwards, attempt to find a pattern within the examples of unclear English production and possible root cause(s).

Afterwards, have a colleague review your recording and speculate the emotion tied to that statement. Discuss with your colleague how they were able to deduce the emotion (if correct) and what inhibited them from matching the correct emotion to the statement (if incorrect). Determine if there is a pattern with any specific emotion that was incorrectly matched.
