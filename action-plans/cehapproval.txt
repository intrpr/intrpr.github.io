Why did you choose this activity?I think this is a beneficial hybrid of both personal enrichment and next-generation interpreter supply creation. I have never submitted this activity for CEH approval before but find it consistent with receiving CEH credit for previous professional development workshops I have taught before.

What are your specific goals? How will you accomplish these goals?My specific goals for students can be found at http://intrpr.github.io/3350 (student learning objectives), (http://intrpr.github.io/3350/syllabus.html (student and instructor expectations), and http://intrpr.github.io/3350/assignments.html (course learning and assignment goals). I will accomplish these objectives by adhering to these guidelines, encouraging students to create goal contracts with me that I review periodically with them, and providing several formative evaluation opportunities (formally: midterm, final, and school-designated and informally: biweekly 'check-ins' with students to see how the course is going for them).
