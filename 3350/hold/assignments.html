				<h3>Due Dates and Missing Exams/Classes</h3>
				<p>Please adhere to all due dates on your class schedule. Exams are given only on the pre-assigned day. Except for extremely exceptional instances, a make-up exam will not be available. Giving a make-up exam is unfair to those students who have made the effort to complete the exam on time.</p>
				<p>Work schedules, out-of-town trips, or dating habits are not valid excuses for missing exams. If you must miss an assignment, please see me <span class="hilite"><em>before the exam day</em></span> to discuss your conflict. Final exams cannot be given early or on any other date than what is proscribed by the College. Please don&#8217;t ask.</p>
				<h3>Assignment Breakdown</h3>
				<p class="hide">You may also want to <a href="writing.html">look at what kind of performance is expected</a> on submitted postings, evaluations, and, to a certain extent (at least principally), your lab assignments.</p>

				<h3>Community Experience Project(s)</h3>
				<p><b>You want me to do <em>what</em>?</b> For these assignments, you should seek out Deaf Community- or interpreter-related activities. Your best resource is the main gathering place for most of the Deaf and interpreting community in Weber, Salt Lake, and Utah Counties, the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=5709+South+1500+West,+Salt+Lake+City,+UT&sll=40.647788,-111.933888&sspn=0.355826,0.529404&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=5709+S+1500+W,+Salt+Lake+City,+Salt+Lake,+Utah+84123&ll=40.64758,-111.933882&spn=0.01112,0.016544&z=16">Sanderson Community Center of the Deaf</a> in Taylorsville. There are activities constantly taking place here, ranging from athletics to political meetings to <a href="https://www.aslterpsutah.org/uip/workshops.php">interpreting workshops</a>. <a href="http://deafservices.utah.gov/">Check the Center</a> for:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>a current list of activities, and</li>
					<li>ask if it is appropriate that students may attend a certain activity. Fees may apply.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>And, when it comes to privacy, Deaf people are no different than hearing people; ask first before just assuming you can show up to any activity.</p>
				<p>Other resources can be found at Salt Lake Community College (Redwood Road campus) or here in Utah County; <abbr><a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/BYU-ASL-CLUB/153072054600">BYU</a></abbr>, <abbr><a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=86095565110&v=info">UVU</a></abbr>, and <abbr><a href="http://www.slcc.edu/asl/aslclub.asp">SLCC</a></abbr> have active, on-going, on-campus <abbr>ASL</abbr> clubs; <abbr>UVU</abbr> has <a href="http://uvu.edu/asd/currentstudents/services.html">periodic inservice for its interpreters</a>. You may even have Deaf friends who are students here at <abbr>UVU</abbr> or <abbr>BYU</abbr>. Explain your assignment to them, and ask what activities may be happening around the area.</p>
				<p>Take advantage of your participation to obtain real-life practical experience in relation to <span class="hilite"><em>interpreting opportunities</em></span> within the Deaf Community. Interact with people&#8212;get involved, ask questions, take opportunities to learn. Make your experience unique and worthwhile. If you need to, ask the instructor for direction and/or clarification. At the end of these experience, write about your interactions.</p>
				<p><b>What this assignment is not.</b> The purpose of this assignment is not to gaze into the proverbial fishbowl nor see how many Deaf people you can hang out and party with (although new social experiences may be a fringe benefit at times.) <span class="hilite">Your participation in the community in which you may someday provide interpreting services is contingent on your perceived relationship with the community.</span> Instead of looking for &#8220;how do you sign that?&#8221; opportunities or just hanging out at league volleyball night, look for ways to build reciprocity, learn about and challenge current situations where interpreters are working, and get in tune with the local interpreting community.</p>
				<p><em>Note</em>: Because Utah and Salt Lake Counties are predominantly heavily <a href="http://deaflds.org/na_ut_id.html">Latter-day Saint (<abbr>LDS</abbr>) populated</a>, many Deaf community activities are also religious activities. <span class="hilite"><strong>It is not an acceptable alternative for this assignment to attend Deaf church services</strong></span>; your involvement and interaction at a church meeting is not indicative of a typical Deaf Community function. If, however, you wish to <a href="http://uad.org/utahresources/churches.htm">investigate religious services</a> as one of your assignments, please discuss your intent with the instructor.</p>

				<h3>Learning &#38; Assignment Goals</h3>
				<p>Among other self-reflective assessments you&#8217;ll make this semester, based on expected learning outcomes, there are three main tactical categories of assignments:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Language and interpretation production</b>. Arguably, the most important technical task new interpreters can practice is the production of interpretation. The process of interpreting has to become familiar in order for it to improve and become more efficacious. So you&#8217;ll be doing lots of language. Lots.</li>
					<ul>
						<li><b>In-class participation, presentations, and producing interpreting work.</b> Interpreting necessitates 1) feeling comfortable in front of a group and 2) learning how to create equivalent renderings of topics. Participation in in-class interpreting assignments, exercises, and feedback sessions is, needless to say, <em>mandatory</em>.</li>
						<li><b>Labs and exercises.</b> This is a 3:3:1 course; in other words, you get three credits in exchange for three weekly hours of coursework and one hour of lab work. Our text, Patrie&#8217;s <em>Effective Interpreting Series</em> is formatted as a workbook, perfect for capturing language lab self- and dyad-paced efforts. From time to time, we may spend time in class working on one of a unit&#8217;s exercises, but you should plan to complete two exercises during your weekly lab time (you&#8217;re completing the third as a video portfolio entry). All lab assignments and due dates (we&#8217;ll be checking those in class) are identified on the <a href="schedule.html">class schedule</a> in <span class="label label-success" style="font-size: inherit;">green</span>.
						<li><b>Creation of a video portfolio</b>. One of the stresses of a large class is the lack of in-class individualized attention. This semester you&#8217;ll be producing interpretations (of the .3 lab in each chapter) and then posting them (with/for commentary) on the video sharing site of your choice. This exercise benefits in two ways: 1) you&#8217;re producing work and 2) you get helpful formative commentary on your work. Scary? Maybe. But super helpful. Did I mention you&#8217;re producing work? See the <a href="schedule.html">class schedule</a> for posting dates identified in <span class="label label-info" style="font-size: inherit;">blue</span>.</li>
					</ul>
				</ol>
				<ol start="2">
					<li><b>Critical reading and thinking</b>. An imperative skillset to be developing at this point in your career is  becoming familiar with relevant literature, learning how to observe the interpreting environment, and then articulating those observations. You&#8217;ll have assignments that provide formative opportunities for these skills.</li>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Unit readings.</b> There are additional readings associated with each unit. This list may or may not change as we go through the semester; new and relevant articles are always being published. Readings which are vital to the discussions we have are marked in <span class="label label-important" style="font-size: inherit;">red</span>. <a href="schedule.html">See the class schedule</a>.</li>
						<li><b>Group quizzes</b>. We&#8217;ll be engaging in group quizzes (given in conjunction with the beginning of workbook units) to discuss our chapter readings. These quizzes are intended to 1) not only assess your understanding of concepts discussed in lectures, readings, and handouts but also 2) allow you to dialog with fellow students. Quizzes are identified on the <a href="schedule.html">class schedule</a> in <span class="label label-warning" style="font-size: inherit;">orange</span>.</li>
						<li><b>Exam</b>. That&#8217;s right: <em>singular</em> exam. There will be one performance (interpreted) exam&#8212;the final&#8212;given at the end of the semester. There&#8217;s only one of these, so unless there&#8217;s an exceptional reason, <span class="hilite">there is no makeup final exam</span>. <a href="schedule.html">See the class schedule</a>.</li>
						<li class="hide">Congratulations, you&#8217;re going to be an author. As part of a collaborative class assignment and as an overall contribution to the literature on this topic, we&#8217;re going to <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Features_of_Consecutive_Interpreting">create chapters of a wiki-based textbook</a> on signed language-based consecutive interpreting. You&#8217;ll work in groups for this assignment, collecting research about and writing a chapter on your group&#8217;s topic. (We&#8217;ll decide about topics in class.) You&#8217;ll have a chance to present your chapter progress at midterm and your final chapter at the end of the semester. Check the <a href="schedule.html">class schedule</a> for due dates.</li>
					</ul>
				</ol>
				<ol start="3">
					<li><b>Community exposure</b>. In order to become a contributing member of the professional community in which you&#8217;re about to join, you need to become familiar with...well, the professional community. You&#8217;ll have at least one opportunity (and more, if you like, for additional credit) to do that this semester.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Based on the criteria described at left under &#8220;Community Experience Projects,&#8221; <b>post at least a one-page-long paper containing your experience(s) on <a href="https://uvu.instructure.com/courses/88295">Canvas</a></b>. In your posting(s) discuss:
							<ul>
								<li>Your thoughts during this interaction with people in relation to the interpreting field. Be honest. Be detailed. Were you surprised at what you learned? Did your feelings about interpreting change during this assignment? How? Why? Explain. </li>
								<li>Other people&#8217;s actions and reactions towards you and your reactions to their behavior. </li>
								<li>Any new awareness and/or insight about interpreting in the community that you had not expected or thought of. Did you gain any new understanding as to the reasons for certain behaviors or cultural morés that Deaf people have? Explain. </li>
								<li>Any anecdotes or descriptions of events that happened that seemed significant or helpful to your experience.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</ol>
				<h3>Self Evaluations</h3>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Student-teacher contract.</b> Determine the parameters of a <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dEFvQW81b0NCSjNsb19aOUh6NXJ6REE6MA..">contract between you and the instructor </a>that will help determine the evaluation and measurement of your in-class performance this semester. What grade do you want? Why? Thoughtfully include what requirements, stipulations, and conditions you&#8217;ll need to satisfy in order to warrant the grade you want to earn from this class. Additionally, explain what you feel the instructor can do/should do to enable your best performance. See the <a href="schedule.html">class schedule</a>; this contract is worth ten points. <span class="hilite">Late submissions will not be accepted.</span></li>
					<li><b>Midterm Evaluation.</b> About halfway through the semester, <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dGhJa0FEZEZTTWprTTkzcTZyRnQ2Z2c6MA">it&#8217;ll be time for a <em>kumbaya</em> of sorts</a>, let the instructor know how you&#8217;re doing&#8212; &#8220;great,&#8221; &#8220;bored,&#8221; &#8220;frustrated&#8221;: get it out. It&#8217;ll be anonymous of course, but it will help you and the instructor do any course correcting if needed. Watch the <a href="schedule.html">class schedule</a> in October for this; this evaluation is worth an easy-peasy ten points. <span class="hilite">Late submissions will not be accepted</span>.</li>
					<li><b>Final Evaluation.</b> After the final exam, you&#8217;ll have a quick final evaluation that will help me understand how you prepared for the exam as well as answer any final concerns or comments about your experience. While it isn&#8217;t graded, it helps me understand if what we practiced was helpful or not. It also helps future classes get the benefit of things in class that you liked or didn&#8217;t like.</li>
